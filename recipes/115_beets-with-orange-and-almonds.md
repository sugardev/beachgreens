=============================

**Serves:** 3-4

 

**Preparation Time:** 2 hours

**Ingredients:**

-   1 bunch beets
-   1 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
-   Zest of 1 orange
-   4 Tablespoons unsalted butter
-   Salt
-   Freshly ground pepper
-   1/3 cup toasted chopped almonds
-   1/2 orange, for garnish
-   2 Tablespoons chopped fresh herbs for garnish

 

**Instructions:**

Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Trim the leaves off the beets, saving for another use. Set the beets in a roasting pan. Bake until the skins are crinkled and loose and a sweet beet smell permeates the kitchen. Medium-sized beets should take about 1-1/2 to 2 hours, small ones about 1-1/2 hours. Cut any extra large beets in half, so that they cook quicker.

Let the beets cool, peel and cut into 3/8-inch cubes. Place the orange juice, orange zest, beets and butter in a shallow saucepan or a skillet. Cook over low to medium heat for 15 minutes -- stirring occasionally -- then raise the heat to high to reduce the cooking liquid, about 2 minutes. The beets should be coated with an orange glaze. Taste. Salt if necessary, and add plenty of freshly ground pepper. Turn into a warm serving dish and top with the almonds. Squeeze the orange half over the cooked beets and garnish with the fresh herbs. Serve immediately.

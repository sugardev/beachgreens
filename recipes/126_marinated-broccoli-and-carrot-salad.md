Marinated Broccoli and Carrot Salad
===================================

**Serves:** 2-3

 

**Preparation Time:** 30 minutes, plus chilling time

**Ingredients:**

-   1 1/2 cups broccoli florets
-   1 Tablespoon olive oil
-   ½ cup chopped onions
-   1/4 cup sliced carrots
-   salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
-   3 tablespoons salad dressing of your choice
-   2 lettuce leaves

 

**Instructions:**

Fill a pot large enough to fit broccoli with water and bring to a boil. Add a generous amount of salt. Add broccoli. Boil 7-10 minutes or until broccoli is crisp-tender and bright green. Drain immediately, running under cold water. This will help retain the beautiful bright green color.

Meanwhile, sauté onions and carrots together with olive oil in a small pan. Salt and pepper to taste. Cook until the onions are soft, and the carrots are still crisp-tender.

Toss vegetables with dressing. Cover and refrigerate about 1 hour or until chilled. Serve on lettuce leaves.

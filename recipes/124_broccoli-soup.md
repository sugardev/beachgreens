**Serves:** 4-6

 

**Preparation Time:** 25 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   2 tablespoons unsalted butter or olive oil
-   1 medium onion, sliced (leeks may be used)
-   1 clove garlic, smashed (optional)
-   1 russet potato, peeled and diced
-   Pinch dried thyme leaves
-   1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed
-   4 cups chicken broth, homemade or low-sodium canned
-   1 pound broccoli
-   2 to 4 tablespoons cream or half-and-half, optional
-   Freshly ground black pepper
-   Optional toppings: shaved Parmesan, shredded cheddar or crumbled bacon

 

**Instructions:**

Melt the butter in a medium saucepan, over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the potato, thyme, salt, and broth and bring to a boil. Adjust the heat to maintain a gentle simmer, and cook uncovered until the potato is fork tender, about 10 minutes. Add the broccoli and simmer for 3 minutes.

Puree the soup in batches in a blender or with an immersion blender. Return soup to the pot and add the cream. Bring to a simmer, taste, and season with salt and pepper.

Serve with optional toppings.

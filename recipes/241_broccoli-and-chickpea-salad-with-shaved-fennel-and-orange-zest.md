Broccoli and Chickpea Salad with Shaved Fennel and Orange Zest
==============================================================

**Serves:** 2

 

**Preparation Time:** 20 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   1-2 scallions or spring onion, thinly sliced
-   ½ bulb fennel, thinly shaved
-   Zest of 1 orange
-   salt
-   ½ - ¾ pound broccoli, cut into florets
-   1 14.5 oz. can chickpeas, drained
-   Juice of one orange
-   Olive oil
-   Sumac (optional)

 

**Instructions:**

Set a pot of salted water to boil. Meanwhile, combine scallion or onion, fennel, orange zest and salt in a salad bowl. Using a pestle, or back of a wooden spoon, muddle the ingredients around until they start to break down. When water has come to a boil, add broccoli, and cook until bright green, and starting to soften. Drain and immediately run under cold water to stop cooking. Drain well, being sure to get off as much water as possible. Toss with onion/fennel/orange mixture, along with the chickpeas, and add juice of the orange, and olive oil, to coat. I used sumac to sprinkle, but this is optional. Adjust seasoning for salt and pepper.

Beet and Celery Salad
=====================

**Serves:** 2-3

 

**Preparation Time:** 1 1/2 hours (20 minutes active time)

**Ingredients:**

-   4 Tablespoons basic salad dressing, (recipe below)
-   1 Tablespoon orange juice
-   1 bunch beets, greens removed
-   2 stalks celery, plus leaves for garnish

 

**Instructions:**

Preheat oven to 425° F. Scrub beets and remove tops and tails. If they are large, cut them in half. Place beets, cut side down, on a baking sheet and surround with a small amount of water. Cover with foil and place in oven. Cook until a knife slides into a beet easily. Remove from oven and let cool. Remove skins and slice beets into rounds or half rounds.

While beets are still warm, combine in a medium mixing bowl with salad dressing and orange juice. Slice celery, including leaves, thin on the bias. Add celery to the bowl and toss together. Place on a platter and top with celery leaves.

**Basic Salad Dressing**

 

-   1 Tablespoon finely chopped onion
-   ½ teaspoon Dijon or whole grain mustard
-   1½ tablespoons red wine vinegar
-   juice from ½ lemon
-   extra virgin olive oil
-   sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

 

Shake or whisk the first 4 ingredients together in a jar. Add enough olive oil to double or triple the amount of liquid in the jar. (depending upon your taste) Season with salt and pepper. This dressing will keep in the refrigerator for a week or two. You may double or triple the amounts easily. Use different types of vinegars for different flavors. Add fresh herbs of your choice.

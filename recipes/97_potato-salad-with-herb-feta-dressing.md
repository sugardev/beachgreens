Potato Salad with Herb Feta Dressing
====================================

**Serves**: 4-6

 

**Preparation Time**: 30 minutes

**Ingredients**:

-   1 ½ -2 pounds potatoes, scrubbed, ½ of them peeled
-   Salt
-   1/3 cup crumbled feta cheese
-   ¼ cup plain yogurt
-   3 Tablespoons Olive Oil
-   1 Tablespoon lemon juice or red wine vinegar
-   ½ teaspoon dried basil or parsley, or use a big handful fresh herbs
-   Salt and pepper to taste

 

**Instructions**:

Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with cold water. Add a generous pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, and cook until just tender. Drain and cut into bite sized pieces.

Meanwhile, combine feta cheese, yogurt, olive oil, lemon juice, herbs, and salt and pepper together in a blender. Process until smooth. While potatoes are still warm, mix with dressing. You may not use all of it. Any leftover dressing will keep in your fridge for about a week. Serve this salad warm, or refrigerate to eat later.

NOTE: I prefer not to peel my potatoes, because a lot of vitamin content is in the skin. However, I find that the skin tends to separate from the potato when mixed around in the salad, and I don’t enjoy the look or texture of this. So, to compromise, I peel half the potatoes. Feel free to do what you like.

====================

Adapted from: [Delish](http://www.delish.com/recipefinder/parsley-walnut-pesto-3625)

**Ingredients:**

-   2 cups (tight-packed) flat-leaf parsley leaves
-   3/4 cup toasted chopped walnuts
-   1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
-   2 cloves (large) garlic, crushed
-   1/2 teaspoon salt
-   1 cup extra-virgin olive oil
-   2 Tablespoons fresh lemon juice
-   2 teaspoons lemon zest

 

**Instructions:**

 

Make the pesto: Place parsley, walnuts, cheese, garlic, and salt in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Pulse until well combined. Combine oil, lemon juice, and zest in a small bowl. Add the oil mixture to parsley mixture in a slow stream, pulsing to combine. Serve immediately or freeze (see Step 2).

 

Freeze the pesto: Divide pesto into preferred serving sizes and place in small resealable plastic bags or small plastic containers with airtight lids. Force excess air out of the container and freeze for up to 3 months.

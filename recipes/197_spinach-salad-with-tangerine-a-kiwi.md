Spinach Salad with Tangerine & Kiwi
===================================

A fabulous winter salad. Use a lighter, sweeter tasting vinegar to complement the sweetness of the fruit.

**Serves:** 4-5
 **Preparation Time:** 20 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   1 bunch spinach, washed and cut into 1” thick ribbons
-   2 satsuma tangerines, peeled and broken into segments
-   1 kiwifruit, peeled and cut into chunks
-   1 tablespoon finely chopped shallots
-   2 tablespoons brown rice or white wine vinegar
-   1 tablespoon freshly squeezed orange or tangerine juice
-   1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
-   6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil

 

**Instructions:**

Combine spinach, tangerines, and kiwi. Whisk together by hand, or in a blender--shallots, vinegar, fruit juice, and mustard. Whisk in olive oil by hand, or slowly add while blender is running. Season to taste with salt and pepper. If you have leftover dressing, it will keep for a week in the refrigerator.

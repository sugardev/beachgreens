Beet Lasagna
============

**Serves:** 3-4

 

**Preparation Time:** 1 1/2 hours

**Ingredients:**

-   1 or 2 bunch red or golden beets, greens separated from root
-   Extra Virgin Olive Oil
-   6 to 8 ounces feta cheese, crumbled
-   1 bunch chard or other greens
-   salt and pepper to taste

 

**Instructions:**

Preheat oven to 375°F. Clean beets, cutting off stems and tail. Cut in half if large. Place cut side down on a baking sheet, and add a small layer of water to the pan. Cover with foil, and bake until soft. Let them cool, peel. Slice thinly.

Meanwhile, clean and de-stem beet greens and chard. Slice into ribbons. Steam briefly until wilted, about 10 minutes. Let cool, and squeeze out extra water from greens with your hands.

Prepare an 8” by 8” baking pan. Lightly drizzle the bottom of the pan with olive oil. Take cooked greens and spread in a thin layer on the bottom. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt and pepper. Then add a layer of sliced beets, slightly overlapping. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Next sprinkle crumbled feta cheese on top. Continue with these layers, ending with feta cheese on top. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until top is browned. If top doesn’t brown, put under broiler for a few minutes.

Grilled Eggplant Salad
======================

Adapted from [Food Network](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/bobby-flay/grilled-eggplant-salad-recipe/index.html)

Ingredients:

-   1 eggplant, cut into 1-inch thick slices
-   1/2 large onion (red or white), cut into rounds
-   Olive oil
-   1 avocado, halved, pitted and flesh chopped
-   1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
-   1 teaspoon Dijon Mustard
-   1 tablespoon coarsely chopped oregano leaves
-   Honey
-   Olive oil
-   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
-   1 lemon, zested
-   Parsley sprigs, for garnish

 

**Instructions:**

Brush the eggplant and red onions with canola oil and arrange on the grill. Cook the eggplant until soft and grill the onions until they have a slight char. Remove from the grill to a cutting board and let cool slightly. Once cool, roughly chop and add them to a serving bowl along with the avocado.

 

In a small bowl, whisk together the red wine vinegar, the Dijon, and oregano. Add honey and olive oil, to taste, and blend until emulsified. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.

 

Add the dressing to the eggplant mixture and toss. Garnish with lemon zest and parsley sprigs and serve.

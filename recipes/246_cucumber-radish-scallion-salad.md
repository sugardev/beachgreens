==============================

**Serves:** varies on use
 **Preparation Time:** 45 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   2 Persian cucumbers, sliced as thin as you can (a mandolin works well for this)
-   salt
-   2 radishes (sliced into rounds, and then sticks)
-   3 purple scallions, white and green parts, minced
-   2 Tablespoons citrus juice (orange or tangerine will work)
-   1 Tablespoon rice wine vinegar

-   5 Tablespoons grapeseed or canola oil
-   Salt and pepper
-   1 teaspoon honey
-   splash soy sauce
-   Sesame seeds for garnish

Â 

**Instructions:**

Put cucumbers in a colander and toss with salt. Place something heavy on top (like a plate topped with a heavy can) to weigh down. Put colander somewhere that it can drain for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, toss together the radishes and scallions in a separate bowl. Whisk together citrus juice, vinegar, oils, salt and pepper, honey, and soy sauce in another bowl. After 30 minutes, squeeze as much liquid as possible out of the cucumbers and add to the radishes and scallions. Toss with the dressing, and garnish with sesame seeds.

Bacon and Balsamic Glazed Sugar Snap Peas
=========================================

from [allrecipes.com](http://allrecipes.com)

**Serves:** 2
 **Preparation Time:** 25 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   1/4 pound bacon, minced
-   1 1/2 cups fresh sugar snap peas
-   2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
-   1 tablespoon raw sugar
-   salt and pepper to taste

 

**Instructions:**

Cook the minced bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until the fat has rendered out and the bacon has begun to crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside, leave the bacon fat in the skillet. Add the sugar snap peas, and toss to coat with the fat. Cook and stir until just cooked through, about 5 minutes. Pour in the balsamic vinegar, sugar, and cooked bacon. Continue cooking until the balsamic has reduced, and the sugar has dissolved, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve immediately.

Variation: For a vegetarian dish, substitute ½ onion, chopped finely, for the bacon. To do this, cook the onion in 2 Tablespoons of butter or oil over medium-high heat for 5 minutes. Turn the heat down to low, and cook onion, stirring occasionally, until the onions turn brown and sweet. If they start to stick, add a touch of water. Remove them, and proceed with recipe, adding a little more fat to cook the peas in.

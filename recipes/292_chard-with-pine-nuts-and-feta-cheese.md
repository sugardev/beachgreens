====================================

**Serves:** 4

 

**Preparation Time:** 20 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   2 Tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
-   1 small onion, chopped
-   1 bunch chard, stems and leaves separated
-   2 cloves garlic, minced
-   about 1 teaspoon salt
-   1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
-   4 Tablespoons pine nuts
-   freshly ground black pepper
-   2-3 oz. feta cheese, crumbled

 

**Instructions:**

Chop chard stems into bite sized pieces, and cut chard leaves into ribbons.

 

In a large sauté pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add onion, chard stems, garlic, salt, and cinnamon and cook for 5 minutes or so. Add chard leaves, and cook, stirring occasionally, until chard is bright green, and barely wilted. Add pine nuts and black pepper. Put onto serving plates, and garnish with crumbled feta cheese.

 

NOTE: This recipe can be adjusted in so many ways. Some delicious additions would be chopped sun-dried tomatoes or chopped carrots. You can use onion or garlic powder if you don't have fresh or can't be bothered chopping. This recipe is also delicious with the addition of ground beef or turkey, or cooked chickpeas (garbanzo beans).

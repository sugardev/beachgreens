**Serves:**4

 

**Preparation Time:**1 3/4 hours (15 minutes active time)

**Ingredients:**

-   1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice or white wine vinegar
-   1 teaspoon cumin seeds, toasted and lightly crushed
-   1/2 teaspoon salt
-   1/4 teaspoon black pepper
-   2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
-   3 medium beets (1 1/4 pound total without greens), trimmed, leaving 1 inch of stems attached
-   1/3 cup fresh mint, coarsely chopped

 

**Instructions:**

Stir together lemon juice or vinegar, cumin seeds, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Stir in oil and let stand while roasting beets.

Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 425°F.

Tightly wrap beets in a double layer of foil and roast on a baking sheet until tender, 1 to 1 1/4 hours. Cool to warm in foil package, about 20 minutes.

When beets are cool enough to handle, peel them, discarding stems and root ends, then cut into 1/2-inch-wide wedges.

Toss warm beets with dressing. Stir in mint just before serving.

**Cooks' note:** Beets can be roasted and tossed with dressing 4 hours ahead, then kept, covered, at room temperature.

==========================

**Serves:** Makes two 8" galettes

 

**Preparation Time:** 2 hours

**Galette Dough (adapted from Julia Child):**

-   3 tablespoons Greek yogurt
-   1/3 cup ice water
-   1 cup all-purpose flour
-   ¼ cup yellow cornmeal
-   1 teaspoon sugar
-   ½ teaspoon salt
-   7 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into ½" pieces

 

**Instructions:**

In a small bowl, stir the Greek yogurt and the ice water together. Set aside. Place flour, cornmeal, sugar and salt into a food processor with metal blade. Pulse until combined. Sprinkle the butter pieces over the flour mixture. Pulse 8 to 10 times. You should still see butter chunks in the mix as large as pea-sized pieces. Add the yogurt mixture and run just until the dough forms soft curd-shaped pieces.

Remove the dough from the processor, divide in half and press into two round disks. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill for at least two hours. Dough can be refrigerated for two days or frozen for up to a month. To thaw, remove from freezer and thaw at room temperature for 20 minutes before rolling between two sheets of parchment.

**Strawberry-Apricot Filling:**

-   6 fresh apricots, sliced
-   1 cup strawberries, sliced
-   2 tablespoons turbinado sugar

 

**To assemble the galette:**

-   4 shortbread cookies (about 1/3 cup), crumbled
-   1 egg
-   1 teaspoon water
-   1 tablespoon turbinado sugar
-   1 tablespoon honey

 

**Instructions:**

Preheat oven to 400º F. Gently toss together apricots, strawberries and 2 tablespoons turbinado sugar. Roll out each piece of dough into a 10" circle on a piece of parchment. In the center of the circle spread half the cookie crumbs on each dough circle up to 2.5" from the edge. Spoon the strawberry-apricot filling over the cookie crumbs and then drizzle with honey. Carefully fold the edges of the dough over the filling. Start in one spot and work your way around the circle, creasing every 3 inches or so. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and water. Brush the egg mixture over the edges of the galette dough. Sprinkle the remaining tablespoon of turbinado sugar over the crust edges. Bake on the parchment paper at 400º F for 35-40 minutes, until edges are golden brown and crisp. Remove from oven, cool slightly and serve warm.

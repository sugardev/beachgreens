Zucchini Fritters
=================

**Serves:** 4
 **Preparation Time:** 45 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   About 1 pound zucchini, grated
-   Salt
-   1/2 pound feta cheese, crumbled
-   ¼- /2 cup finely chopped fresh herb of your choice (optional)
-   4 green onions, finely chopped
-   3 eggs, beaten
-   1/2 cup flour
-   Freshly ground black pepper
-   Oil for frying

 

**Instructions:**

Place grated zucchini in a colander, sprinkle with salt and let stand at least 20 minutes, or until it loses its juice. Squeeze dry and place in a large bowl. Add the cheese, herb, onions, eggs, flour, and pepper and mix well. Adjust the seasonings. If batter is too runny, add a little more flour.

Heat oil in a heavy saucepan. Drop batter by tablespoons into oil and fry until golden brown on all sides but still moist inside, about 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels and serve warm.

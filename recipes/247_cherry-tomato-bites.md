===================

Adapted from [The Kitchn](http://www.thekitchn.com/thekitchn/hors-doeuvres/recipe-cherry-tomato-bites-124738)

**Ingredients:**

-   1 pint cherry tomatoes
-   Fresh mozzarella, cubed
-   Olive oil
-   Salt
-   Fresh ground pepper
-   Basil, julienned

 

**Instructions:**

Cut a small slice off the end of each tomato so that they sit level. (Make sure not to cut too big of a slice or else the cup won't have a bottom.)

 

Make another slice on the opposite side of the tomato and scoop out the pulp inside using a melon baller or small spoon. Be careful not to puncture the skin on the bottom. (Don't worry about what it looks like because it will soon be stuffed.)

 

Season the tomato cups with salt and pepper. Place a cube of mozzarella in each cup.

 

Drizzle olive oil over the stuffed tomatoes. Garnish each bite with a bit of basil. Transfer the bites onto a serving platter and chill until ready to serve.

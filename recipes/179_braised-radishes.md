Braised Radishes
================

Adapted from [*Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone* by Deborah Madison](http://www.deborahmadison.com/)

**Serves:** 4
 **Preparation Time:** 25 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   20 radishes, red or multicolored
-   1 to 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
-   1 shallot, minced finely
-   1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
-   salt and freshly ground black pepper
-   water

 

**Instructions:**

Trim the leaves from the radishes. Scrub the radishes. If the leaves are tender and in good condition, wash them and set aside. Leave smaller radishes whole, and half or quarter larger ones.

Melt 2 to 3 teaspoons butter in a small sauté pan over medium heat. Add the shallot and thyme and cook one minute. Add the radishes, a little salt and pepper, and water just to cover. Cover and simmer until the radishes are tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the leaves, if using, and cook until wilted and tender, about 1 minute more. Remove the radishes (and leaves) to a serving dish. Boil the liquid in the pan, until slightly reduced. Add a teaspoon or two more butter to create a sauce. Pour over radishes and serve.

**Note:***You may substitute 1 tablespoon chopped onion for shallot. You may also substitute any fresh herb for the thyme.*

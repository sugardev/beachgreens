Piperade, a spicy tomato-pepper sauce from the Basque region of France can be used as a stewing ingredient or a garnish to a finished dish. Delicious with fish or even over a cheese omelet.

 

**Serves:** 4

 

**Preparation Time:** 1 hour 45 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
-   1 large Spanish onion, chopped
-   2 red bell pepper, seeded and chopped
-   1 Anaheim peppers, seeded and finely chopped
-   2 cloves garlic, crushed and finely chopped
-   ½ teaspoon salt
-   1/4 teaspoon sweet paprika
-   1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
-   ¼ teaspoon granulated sugar
-   1 15 oz can diced tomatoes

 

**Instructions:**

Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Sauté the onion, peppers, garlic, salt, paprika, black pepper, and sugar, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes, until the vegetables are cooked through. Add the tomatoes to the cooked vegetables and simmer the mixture, uncovered, for 15 minutes, until most of the liquid has evaporated and the sauce has thickened.

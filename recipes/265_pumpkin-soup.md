============

Adapted from [Good Life Eats](http://www.goodlifeeats.com/2010/11/pumpkin-soup-with-toasted-walnuts.html)

**Serves:** 4

 

**Preparation Time:** 45 minutes

Ingredients:

-   2 tablespoons butter
-   2 medium leeks, white and pale green parts only, finely chopped
-   2 medium carrots, finely chopped
-   1 rib celery, finely chopped
-   2 garlic cloves, minced
-   3/4 teaspoon cumin
-   3/4 teaspoon coriander
-   1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
-   3 cups chicken broth, plus extra for thinning
-   1 - 15 ounce can pure pumpkin puree (or 2 cups fresh baked pumpkin or winter squash puree)
-   1/3 cup maple syrup
-   1/2 cup half and half
-   salt and pepper, to taste
-   walnuts and blue cheese for garnish

 

**Instructions:** Melt the butter in a medium dutch oven pan over medium heat. Add the leeks, carrot, and celery and cook until softened, 5-7 minutes. Stir in the garlic, cumin, coriander, and nutmeg. Continue to saute and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.

 

Stir in the broth, making sure to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Bring the soup to a boil and cook for about 5 minutes. Stir in the pumpkin and syrup and cook an additional 10 minutes. Working in batches, if necessary, puree the soup in a food processor or blender until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Return the soup to the dutch oven.

 

Stir in the half and half and and additional broth to adjust the soup's consistency (I didn't have to add any extra liquid). Season to taste with salt and pepper and heat gently over low heat until hot. Garnish individual bowls with walnuts and blue cheese.

 

To toast the walnuts: toss them with a bit of olive oil and saute in a small pan or toast in the toaster oven for 3-5 minutes, or until fragrant.

As the weather cools down (really, one day, it will!), this is a delicious cozy fall snack. Serve with a hearty salad and bread, and you have a complete meal!

**Serves:** 6

 

**Preparation Time:** 2 hours

**Ingredients:**

-   1 3/4 pounds butternut squash (medium size)
-   1 large onion, chopped
-   2 garlic cloves, minced
-   2 tablespoons olive oil
-   1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
-   1 teaspoon salt
-   1 teaspoon curry powder
-   1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
-   5 cups chicken broth
-   1 bay leaf

*Yogurt Topping*

-   ¾ cup plain whole milk yogurt
-   1/4 cup minced fresh cilantro or parsley (good quality dried would work too!)

 

**Instructions:**

Cut squash in half lengthwise; discard seeds. Place squash cut side down in a greased or foil-lined baking pan. Bake, uncovered, at 400°F for 40-50 minutes or until tender. When cool enough to handle, scoop out pulp; set aside. In a large saucepan, saute onion and garlic in oil until tender. Add the flour, salt, curry powder, cayenne, and cook for 1-2 minutes. Stir in broth. Add bay leaf. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Discard bay leaf. Cool to room temperature.

In a blender or food processor, place half of the broth mixture and squash; cover and process until smooth. Repeat with remaining broth mixture and squash. Return to the saucepan; heat through. Combine the topping ingredients; place a dollop on each serving.

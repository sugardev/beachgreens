Spring Asparagus and Mushroom Risotto
=====================================

**Serves:** 4

 

**Preparation Time:** 45 minutes-1 hour

**Ingredients:**

-   1 Tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
-   1 small onion, chopped
-   2 cloves garlic, minced
-   2 fresh thyme sprigs, or 1/2 teaspoon dried
-   1/4 teaspoon saffron threads
-   1 pound Arborio rice
-   1 cup dry white wine
-   4 cups vegetable broth plus 1 cup water or additional broth
-   8-10 medium spears asparagus, thinly sliced on a bias
-   2 cups sliced mushrooms of your choice
-   3 oz. shredded Parmesan cheese
-   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

 

**Instructions:**

Heat oil in a large heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add onions, garlic, thyme, and saffron; saute 2 minutes. Add the rice and stir to coat well with oil. Add the white wine and simmer until the wine is absorbed. Add 1/2 cup broth (plus water, if using) at a time and simmer until each addition is almost absorbed before adding the next one. When there is 1 cup remaining broth to be added to the pan, add the asparagus and mushrooms. Then continue adding the broth.

When all the liquid is added and absorbed, the rice will be tender but al dente. Add the Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper. Remove the thyme springs, if using, and serve.

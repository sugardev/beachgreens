Braised Chard
=============

**Serves:** 2-3 as a side dish
 **Preparation Time:** 35 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
-   1 large yellow onion, sliced
-   1 bunch chard, stems removed and leaves cut into thick ribbons
-   1 tablespoon water
-   salt and freshly ground black pepper

Â 

**Instructions:**

Heat olive oil in a medium size saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook, stirring, for about 7-10 minutes, until the onions have softened and browned a little. Add chard and water and turn the heat down to medium low. Scrape the stuck bits from the bottom of the pan. Cover and cook for 10-15 minutes, until the chard is soft. Uncover in the last few minutes of cooking to allow some of the extra liquid to evaporate.

Variations: Cook 3 or 4 slices of bacon or pancetta in the pan before adding the onion, and omit the olive oil. Add lemon juice at the end for a brighter flavor. Sprinkle with Parmesan or other cheese at the end of cooking. Add eggs to create a frittata or omelet.

Feel free to add whatever you have on hand to this salad.

**Serves:** 8
 **Preparation Time:** 30 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   1 1/2 cups Orzo, long rice shaped pasta
-   Chicken Broth
-   1/3 cup chopped Fresh Tomatoes
-   4 Tablespoons Extra Virgin Olive Oil
-   1/4 cup White Balsamic Vinegar, Dark Balsamic can be used but will darken the color
-   1/4 cup chopped Kalamata olives or other brine-cured black olives, optional
-   1 cup grated zucchini
-   1/2 cup Pine Nuts, toasted for 6 mins in 375°F oven
-   1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan or Feta cheese
-   2 large Garlic cloves, minced (optional)
-   Salt & Pepper to taste

 

**Instructions:**

Cook orzo in pot of boiling chicken broth until just tender but still firm to bite, about 9 minutes.

Drain well. Transfer to large bowl. Add tomatoes, oil, vinegar and olives and toss to blend. Let stand until cool. Can be made ahead to this point. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before continuing.

Throw the zucchini, pine nuts, Parmesan and garlic into orzo mixture. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Can be served room temperature or cold. Keeps for several days.

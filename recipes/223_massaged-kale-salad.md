Massaged Kale Salad
===================

Adapted from [Cookus Interruptus](http://www.cookusinterruptus.com/index.php?video_id=124#_)

**Serves:** 2-3

 

**Preparation Time:** 15 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   1 bunch kale (about 1/2 pound)
-   1/2-3/4 teaspoon sea salt
-   1/4 cup sunflower seeds, toasted, some reserved for garnish
-   1/8 cup sliced onion (red or white, chopped scallions work too)
-   2 Tablespoons dried cherries or cranberries or other dried fruit, roughly chopped
-   1 small apple, cored and diced
-   3 Tablespoons olive oil
-   1-2 Tablespoons unfiltered apple cider vinegar

 

**Instructions:** Remove stems from kale leaves by pulling leaf away from both sides of the stem in one swift movement. Once de-stemmed, in 2 batches, stack leaves, roll up and cut into thin ribbons (chiffonade). Wash and drain well in a colander.

 

While draining, prepare sunflower seeds, onion, dried fruit and apple. To toast sunflower seeds, put in a dry skillet over low heat for a few minutes, stirring often, until they give off a nutty aroma, and remove immediately from the pan so they don't overtoast.

 

Put drained kale in a salad bowl. Add salt, massage salt into kale with your hands for 1-2 minutes.

 

Pour off any leftover liquid after massaging kale. Stir onion, dried fruit, apple and most of the toasted seeds into kale. Dress with oil and vinegar and toss. Taste for salt and vinegar, adding more if necessary. Garnish with sunflower seeds and serve.

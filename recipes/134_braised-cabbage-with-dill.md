**Serves:** 4
 **Preparation Time:** 35 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   8 oz. carrots, peeled and thinly sliced

**Instructions:**

In a covered skillet, bring to a boil the carrots, stock, and butter. Reduce the heat and simmer until the carrots are crisp-tender, about 7-9 minutes. Add cabbage, cream, and dill. Cook covered, over low heat until the cabbage wilts, about 10 minutes. Uncover, stir well, and cook until cabbage is tender and the pan juices are a syrupy consistency, about 10 minutes more. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

===========================

Adapted from [Cook Think](http://www.cookthink.com/recipe/20227/Cauliflower_And_Turnip_Mash)

**Serves:** 4-6

 

**Preparation Time:** 25 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   2 bay leaves
-   1 head cauliflower, prepped into florets
-   3/4 pound turnips, peeled and cubed into 1/2-inch dice
-   1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt
-   2 tablespoons unsalted butter
-   2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme
-   1 teaspoon hot sauce
-   1/2 cup grated hard goat's cheese

 

**Instructions:**

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil with the bay leaves and add in the cauliflower florets and prepped turnips. Cook until done, about 15-20 minutes.

 

Drain the vegetables well and remove the bay leaves. Remove to the food processor and pulse until desired mashed consistency is reached, or until smooth.

 

Return the mashed cauliflower and turnips to the large pot and cook over medium heat for 5-8 minutes to steam off the extra water. Do not brown.

 

Remove the mashed mixture from the heat and stir in the Greek yogurt, butter, thyme, hot sauce and goat's cheese. Add a sprinkling of salt and pepper and serve immediately.

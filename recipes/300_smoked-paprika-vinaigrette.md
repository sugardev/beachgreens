It’s that time of year when the weather warms up, and the time spent in the kitchen becomes less. With the gorgeous weather beckoning outside, who wants to spend hours in the kitchen? Recipes become simpler (grilling, steaming), and I think having a couple of delicious vinaigrette recipes on hand to drizzle over any cooked veggie is a must. Try this one out!

 

**Ingredients:**

-   1/2 cup red wine vinegar
-   1/3 cup honey
-   1 tablespoon stone-ground mustard
-   1 tablespoon lime or lemon juice
-   3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
-   3/4 teaspoon salt
-   1 1/4 teaspoons smoked paprika
-   1 clove garlic
-   2 tablespoons chopped onion
-   1/4 teaspoon oregano
-   1 pinch white sugar (optional)
-   1/2 cup olive oil

 

**Instructions:**

Blend the red wine vinegar, honey, mustard, lime juice, pepper, salt, paprika, garlic, onion, oregano, and sugar together in a blender until thoroughly mixed. Drizzle the olive oil into the mixture while blending on low. Chill at least 1 hour before serving.

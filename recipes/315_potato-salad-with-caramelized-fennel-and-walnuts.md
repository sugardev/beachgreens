Potato Salad with Caramelized Fennel and Walnuts
================================================

**Serves**: 3-4

 

**Preparation Time**: 45 minutes

**Ingredients**:

-   1 1/2 pounds 'Sierra Gold' potato
-   apple cider vinegar
-   Olive Oil
-   Salt and Pepper to taste
-   1 fennel bulb
-   1/2 small onion
-   1-2 garlic cloves
-   1 teaspoon fennel seed
-   1-2 Tablespoons plain yogurt
-   walnut oil
-   1 cup walnuts, or to taste, toasted

 

**Instructions**:

Place potatoes in a pot and cover with cold water. Add a good pinch of salt. Turn heat to high and boil until soft. When soft, drain and return to pot. Add some olive oil, apple cider vinegar, and salt to potatoes while they are still hot, as they will soak up some flavor.

 

While potatoes are cooking, dice fennel bulb and onion finely, reserving some of the fennel frond. Heat a saute pan over medium high heat. When pan is hot, add 2 Tablespoons olive oil. Cook diced fennel and onion for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until bits start to brown on the bottom of the pan. Turn heat to low and cook for about another 10 minutes. You want the fennel and onion to be nice a soft and brown. A little bit of sticking is okay.

 

While fennel and onion are cooking, mash garlic in a mortar and pestle with a pinch of salt and fennel seed. Add this mixture to the fennel/onion mixture towards the end of cooking, cook for 2 minutes, being careful not to let the garlic burn. Remove fennel/onion/garlic mixture and let cool slightly. Chop finely, or pulse mixture in food processor with yogurt until a paste. Dice cooked potatoes and place in a large bowl. Add fennel/onion/garlic puree to cooked potatoes.

 

Add walnut oil to taste, and more apple cider vinegar until tangy enough. Also season with salt and pepper. Chop fennel fronds and mix in, and garnish with fennel fronds and walnuts.

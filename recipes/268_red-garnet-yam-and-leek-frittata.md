================================

Adapted from [Rachael Ray Show](http://www.rachaelrayshow.com/food/recipes/sweet-potato-and-leek-fritatta/)

**Serves:** 4-6

 

**Preparation Time:** 1 hour

**Ingredients:**

-   3 Tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
-   2 large red garnet yams (sweet potatoes), cut in half and thinly sliced
-   2 medium leeks, thinly sliced
-   4 cloves garlic, finely chopped or grated
-   12 extra large eggs
-   1/3 cup milk or half and half
-   A splash of hot sauce
-   salt and freshly ground black pepper
-   1/2 cup shredded white sharp cheddar cheese
-   1/2 cup (a couple of handfuls) flat-leaf parsley leaves, chopped

 

**Instructions:**

Preheat oven to 400°F. Heat a 12-inch, nonstick, oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Add oil, potatoes, leeks and garlic, and cook until the veggies are tender, 6-7 minutes.

 

Beat eggs together with half-and-half, a splash of hot sauce, some salt and pepper. Pour the eggs in the skillet over the filling. Using a spatula, raise the cooked egg off the bottom of the pan, allowing more of the still-liquid eggs to settle on the bottom of the pan.

 

When the frittata has set, sprinkle the top with cheese and transfer to the oven. Cook for 10-12 minutes until top is deep golden brown. Remove and let stand 5 minutes. Garnish with parsley, cut into wedges and serve.

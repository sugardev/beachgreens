Coconut Sweet Potato Stew
=========================

Use whichever vegetables you have handy for this stew.

**Serves:** 3-4
 **Preparation Time:** 45 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   1 tablespoon olive oil, butter, ghee, or coconut oil
-   1 onion, chopped
-   1 tablespoon curry powder
-   ½ fresh Serrano chili, minced, or 1 teaspoon dried chili flakes (optional)
-   2 quarter-sized slices fresh ginger, peeled and minced
-   1 carrot, chopped
-   2 cloves garlic, minced
-   2 yams, peeled and cut into matchsticks (see note)
-   1 can coconut milk
-   1 cup water or stock
-   1 cup leafy greens (Chard, spinach, kale, or braising mix), washed and cut into pieces
-   ¼ teaspoon turmeric
-   ¼ cup cilantro, chopped (optional)
-   1 lemon or lime, juiced (optional)
-   salt

 

**Instructions:**

Heat oil in a 4 to 6-quart pot over medium heat. Add onion and cook for 2 minutes. Add curry powder, chili, and ginger and cook for 2 minutes. Add carrot, garlic and yam, and cook until carrot begins to soften. Add coconut milk and water or stock and bring to a gentle boil. If using chard, kale, or braising mix, add now and cook until yams are soft and greens are tender. If using spinach, first cook yams until they are soft, then add the spinach in the last 5 minutes of cooking. Add turmeric. Add cilantro and lemon or lime juice, if using. Season to taste with salt. Serve stew over rice.

**Notes:** Try adding at the end--shrimp or cooked chicken, sausage, cooked beans, or lentils.

*To cut yams into matchsticks, peeled and slice into 1/4 “ slices. Cut each slice across into ¼” pieces.*

Turkish Style Braised Green Beans
=================================

This recipe comes from a group of traditional Turkish dishes that are served in olive oil, cold or at room temperature. They are great for a light lunch, first course, or side dish. Don’t be alarmed by the large amount of olive oil in this recipe, it is meant to be served with crusty bread for dipping in the extra olive oil. The amounts given are very flexible.

 

**Serves:** 3-4 as a side dish

 

**Preparation Time:** 45 minutes plus cooling time

**Ingredients:**

-   ½ cup plus 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
-   ½ large onion, finely chopped (leeks may be used)
-   1 carrot, finely chopped (1/2 teaspoon sugar may be used instead)
-   1\# green beans, topped, tailed, and cut into bite-size pieces
-   2 tomatoes, chopped
-   1 tablespoon tomato paste
-   ½ cup warm water
-   salt, to taste

 

**Instructions:** In a medium size skillet, over medium heat, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil. When hot, add onion a cook for 3 minutes. Add carrot and cook for 2 minutes. Add green beans, tomatoes, and tomato paste, and cook 3 minutes. Add ½ cup olive oil and warm water. Adjust heat so that the mixture simmers. Simmer uncovered for anywhere from 25-45 minutes, depending on how soft you like your green beans. Check liquid level periodically, and add more water if necessary. By the end of cooking there should not be much water left. Add salt to taste. Let cool, or put in refrigerator to cool off. Beans will last 3 days in the refrigerator.

Purple Cauliflower with Golden Raisins and Pinenuts
===================================================

Adapted from a [Marcella Hazan](http://www.amazon.com/Essentials-Classic-Italian-Cooking-Marcella/dp/039458404X) recipe

 

Note: *The cauliflower will lose some of its purple hue with cooking.*

**Serves:** 4-6

 

**Preparation Time:** 45 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   1 oz seedless raisins
-   1 head cauliflower, about 1 ½ lbs
-   1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
-   2 teaspoons garlic, chopped fine
-   1 oz pine nuts
-   salt
-   black pepper in a grinder

 

**Instructions:**

Soak the raisins in water for 15 to 20 minutes.

Trim the cauliflower of all its outer leaves except for the tender, almost totally white ones. Drop the head into 4 quarts of boiling water. After the water returns to a boil, cook for 6 to 7 minutes until it is halfway done, that is, until you feel resistance when pricking it with a fork. Drain it and cut it into 1 ½-inch pieces.

When the raisins have finished soaking, drain them and squeeze them gently in your hands to force off excess liquid.

Choose a lidded saute pan that can subsequently accommodate all the cauliflower pieces without overlapping. Put in the oil and the garlic and turn on the heat to medium without covering the pan.

When the garlic becomes colored a pale gold, add the cauliflower, raisins, pine nuts, salt, generous grindings of pepper, cover the pan, and turn down the heat to low. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes or more, stirring from time to time, until the cauliflower feels tender when tested with a fork.

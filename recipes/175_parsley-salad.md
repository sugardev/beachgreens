Parsley Salad
=============

Besides just a garnish or flavoring, parsley can be used to make a salad all on its own.

**Serves:** 2-3
 **Preparation Time:** 20 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   1 bunch parsley, stems removed and finely chopped
-   lemon juice or vinegar of your choice
-   extra virgin olive oil
-   salt and freshly ground black pepper
-   freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Â 

**Instructions:**

Toss parsley in a bowl with lemon juice or vinegar, olive oil, salt and pepper to taste. Add freshly grated Parmesan cheese if desired.

Variation: Add cooked rice or barley. Adding bulghur wheat will make tabbouleh, a Middle Eastern Salad dish. Other vegetables, such as cucumbers, tomatoes or scallions go well with parsley.

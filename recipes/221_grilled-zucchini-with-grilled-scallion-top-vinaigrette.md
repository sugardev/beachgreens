Grilled Zucchini with Grilled Scallion Top Vinaigrette
======================================================

**Serves:** 2

 

**Preparation Time:** 30 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   green tops of 1 bunch of scallions
-   1-2 Tablespoons white balsamic vinegar, or champagne vinegar
-   olive oil
-   2-3 medium zucchini
-   olive oil
-   salt and pepper
-   goat cheese, for garnish

 

**Instructions:**

 

Grill green onion tops, drizzled with a little olive oil, until charred but not completely black. Place in food processor with vinegar, and enough olive oil to make a paste, and salt and pepper.

 

Cut zucchini into slices lengthwise, and drizzle with olive oil, salt and pepper. When grill is hot, grill over a medium fire until they have nice grill marks and are no longer raw. Don't cook too long, or they will fall apart.

 

Serve drizzled with vinaigrette, and possibly some goat cheese as a garnish.

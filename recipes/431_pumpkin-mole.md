**Serves**:

 

**Preparation Time**:

**Ingredients**:

-   3 Tablespoons butter or oil
-   1 large onion, chopped
-   2-3 cloves garlic, chopped
-   1 jalapeno (optional), chopped
-   ½ teaspoon ground cumin
-   ½ teaspoon ground coriander
-   2 small sized kabocha squash, cleaned, partially peeled, and cut into large chunks
-   ½ jar Mole Monarca from Peppered Up Foods
-   1 - 1.5 cups water or stock
-   2 medium tomatoes, chopped
-   1 15 oz. can pinto or black beans
-   salt and pepper to taste
-   pumpkin seeds (for garnish)

 

**Instructions**:

Heat oil in a large shallow pan over medium-high heat. Add onion, garlic, jalapeno, spices, and a sprinkling of salt. Cook until onion is soft, 10-15 minutes. Stir occasionally so the garlic doesn’t burn. Once the onion is soft, add squash chunks, Mole, and water or stock. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook until squash is soft, but not falling apart. Once squash is soft, remove the lid, and add tomatoes and beans, and cook until heated through. Taste and adjust for salt and pepper. Serve over quinoa or rice or pasta. Garnish with pumpkin seeds. Also makes a delicious burrito filling.

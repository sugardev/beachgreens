Stuffed Roasted Strawberries
============================

Adapted from [What's Cookin America](http://www.whatscookingamerica.net)

**Serves:** 2-3
 **Preparation Time:** 30 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   8-10 large fresh strawberries (the bigger the better!)
-   1 to 2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped
-   1 teaspoon sugar
-   Fresh whipped cream
-   Cocoa powder, for garnishing

Â 

**Instructions:**

Slice the tops of the berries off just below the stem. Cut the tips off (about 1/4-inch), so that the berries will sit upright. Next, use a small spoon or a melon ball scoop to hollow out the strawberries, working from their tops, in order to create a cavity in each one. Stuff some chocolate into the cavity of each strawberry and place them upright in a baking dish. Lightly sprinkle the berries with sugar. Roast the berries until soft and the chocolate is melted, about 10 to 12 minutes; remove from oven.

To serve, place 3 strawberries on a dessert plate in a triangle. If the berries have given off liquid in the baking dish, spoon it over them. Spoon a small mound of cream in the center of the berries, and top each berry with a dollop of cream. Sift a little cocoa powder over the plate, and serve!

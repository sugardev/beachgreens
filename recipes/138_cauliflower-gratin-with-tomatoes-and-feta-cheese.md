Cauliflower Gratin with Tomatoes and Feta Cheese
================================================

**Serves:** 4
 **Preparation Time:** 40 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   2-3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
-   1 onion, thinly sliced (can substitute scallion)
-   2 garlic cloves, chopped (optional)
-   1½ teaspoons dried oregano leaves
-   1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
-   1 15-ounce can diced tomatoes or 5 fresh tomatoes, peeled, seeded and diced
-   1 teaspoon honey
-   1 tablespoon capers, rinsed and finely minced
-   salt and freshly ground black pepper
-   1 large cauliflower head, broken into florets.
-   ½ lemon, juiced or 1 Tablespoon white wine vinegar
-   2-4 ounces feta cheese, crumbled
-   parsley, chopped

 

**Instructions:** Preheat the broiler. Lightly oil a 2-quart gratin or casserole dish.

Heat the oil in a medium size skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, oregano, and cinnamon, and cook until onion is wilted, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, cook for 7 minutes more, then add the honey and capers and season with salt and pepper. Slide the mixture into the gratin/casserole dish.

Steam the cauliflower for 5 minutes. Set it on the tomato mixture and season it with salt and pepper. Squeeze lemon juice over the top and add the feta. Place under the broiler until the sauce is bubbling and the cheese is beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Garnish with chopped parsley and serve.

Red Cabbage Braised with Maple and Ginger
=========================================

Adapted from [*All About Braising* by Molly Stevens](http://www.mollystevenscooks.com/books.php)

**Serves:** 6-8
 **Preparation Time:** 1 1/2 hours

**Ingredients:**

-   2 slices thick cut bacon cut into ½” wide strips
-   1½ tablespoons unsalted butter
-   1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced
-   1 apple, peeled, cored, and thinly sliced
-   1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger, or ½ teaspoon dried
-   1 medium head red cabbage, quartered, cored, and thinly sliced
-   ¼ cup cider vinegar
-   2 tablespoons pure maple syrup
-   salt and freshly ground black pepper

 

**Instructions:** Preheat oven to 300?F.

Heat a large deep ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Add bacon and cook until the bacon renders its fat and begins to crisp, 5 minutes. Scoop out the bacon with a slotted spoon and set aside to drain. Add the butter to the bacon fat in the pan and stir in the sliced onion. Season with salt and pepper and sauté, stirring a few times, until the onion turns limp, about 2 minutes. Add the apple and ginger and stir to combine. Increase the heat to medium high and begin adding the cabbage a few handfuls at a time. Once all the cabbage is in the skillet, sauté, stirring frequently, until the strands begin to wilt and have a moist gleam, about 6 minutes. Add the cider vinegar and syrup, and return the bacon to the pan. Stir to incorporate, and let the liquid come to a boil.

Cover the pan and slide it into the middle of the oven. Braise at a gentle simmer, stirring every 20 minutes, until the cabbage is tender and deeply fragrant, about 1 hour. Serve warm or at room temperature.

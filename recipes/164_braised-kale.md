Braised Kale
============

You may use a variety of greens for this dish—kale, chard, collards, beet greens. How long you cook them depends on how tough the green is, and how soft you like your greens.

**Serves:** 2-3 as a side dish

**Preparation Time:** 35 minutes

**Ingredients:**

2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil

1 large yellow onion, sliced

1 bunch kale, stems removed and leaves cut into thick ribbons

¼ cup vegetable stock or water

salt and freshly ground black pepper

**Instructions:**

Heat olive oil in a medium size saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook, stirring, for about 7-10 minutes, until the onions have softened and browned a little. Add kale and vegetable stock and turn the heat down to medium low. Scrape the stuck bits from the bottom of the pan. Cover and cook for 10-15 minutes, until the kale is soft. Uncover in the last few minutes of cooking to allow some of the extra liquid to evaporate.

***Variations:*** Cook 3 or 4 slices of bacon or pancetta in the pan before adding the onion, and omit the olive oil. Add lemon juice at the end for a brighter flavor. Sprinkle with Parmesan or other cheese at the end of cooking. Add eggs to create a frittata or omelet.

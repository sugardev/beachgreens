Brussels Sprouts with Bacon and Apple
=====================================

**Serves:** 4 as a side dish
 **Preparation Time:** 30 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   2 slices nitrite-free bacon, chopped into pieces
-   1 medium sized onion, sliced into half-moons
-   1 pound Brussels Sprouts, ends trimmed, and thinly sliced
-   1 apple, cored, peeled, and cut into small pieces
-   salt and freshly ground black pepper
-   ½ cup stock or water
-   dollop plain yogurt or sour cream (optional)

 

**Instructions:**

Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add bacon and cook until almost crispy, and is rendering its fat. Add onion, and cook until softening. Add Brussels Sprouts and apple, turn heat up, and cook for 5 minutes. Lower heat, add stock or water, salt and pepper, and cover, simmer until Brussels Sprouts are soft, about 15-20 minutes. If desired, add yogurt or sour cream after taking the pan off the heat.

Great served over some killer mashed potatoes!

**Note:** *You may make this vegetarian by omitting the bacon, and using butter or olive oil as your fat.*

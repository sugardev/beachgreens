===================================================

Recipe courtesy of [Artichoke Advisory Board of California](http://www.artichokes.org)

**Serves:** 2

 

**Preparation Time:** 1 hour, plus marinating overnight

**Ingredients:**

-   2 medium artichokes
-   1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
-   1/4 cup water
-   1/4 cup soy sauce
-   1 Tbs. minced ginger
-   1/4 cup olive oil

 

**Instructions:**

Slice artichoke tops off, crosswise. Trim stems. Boil or steam artichokes for about 30 minutes or until bottoms pierce easily or a petal pulls off easily.

Drain artichokes. Cool. Cut each in half lengthwise and scrape out fuzzy center and any purple-tipped petals.

Mix remaining ingredients in a large plastic bag. Place artichokes in bag and coat all side of artichokes with mixture. Marinate for at least 1 hour. For best flavor, marinate overnight. Drain artichokes, reserving marinade. Place, cut-side down, on a grill over a bed of medium-hot coals. Grill until lightly browned on the cut side, 5 to 7 minutes. Turn over and drizzle more marinade on artichokes. Grill until petal tips are lightly charred, 3 to 4 minutes more. Serve hot or at room temperature.

Creamy Dip

-   1/4 cup creamy peanut butter
-   1/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar
-   2 Tbs. cider vinegar
-   2 Tbs. soy sauce
-   1 tsp. sesame oil
-   1/8 tsp. ground ginger

Combine all ingredients; mix well.

=====================

Adapted from [Sunset Magazine](http://oneblockdiet.sunset.com/2011/06/easy-green-bean-salad.html)

 

**Serves:** 3-4

 

**Preparation Time:** 25 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   About 1 pound green beans, stem ends plucked off
-   A handful of sliced kalamata olives
-   2 to 3 hardboiled eggs, roughly chopped
-   About ½ cup roughly chopped flat-leaf parsley, plus some whole leaves (optional, or substitute another herb)
-   Good extra-virgin olive oil (it matters in a recipe this simple)
-   Red wine vinegar
-   Freshly ground black pepper

 

**Instructions:**

 

1. Cook green beans in boiling water until just tender, about 3 minutes. Drain, then run cold water over them until they’re cool. Pat dry.

 

2. Whisk together olives, some of the egg, the chopped parsley, a few tbsp. olive oil, and a splash of vinegar. Spoon over green beans. Top with remaining egg, some parsley leaves, a drizzle of olive oil, and a sprinkling of pepper.

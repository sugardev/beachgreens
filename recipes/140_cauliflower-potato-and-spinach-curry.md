**Serves:** 4
 **Preparation Time:** 1 hour

**Ingredients:**

-   ½ head cauliflower, cut into florets
-   2 medium potatoes, cut into ½ inch cubes
-   1 large apple, peeled, cored, and sliced
-   3 cloves garlic, sliced
-   One 2-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and sliced
-   2 hot fresh chili peppers, such as jalapeno or Serrano, seeded and sliced (optional)
-   ¼ cup vegetable oil or clarified butter
-   2 medium onions, coarsely chopped
-   2 Tablespoons curry powder
-   1 Tablespoon all-purpose flour
-   One 14-ounce can unsweetened coconut milk
-   ½ cup water or vegetable or chicken stock
-   1 teaspoon salt
-   One 16-ounce can chickpeas, drained
-   12 ounces fresh spinach, stemmed, washed and torn (you may also substitute chard)
-   Freshly ground black pepper to taste
-   Hot Cooked Rice

 

**Instructions:**

Set a large pot of water to boil. Boil cauliflower for 5 minutes, remove with slotted spoon and transfer to a bowl of ice water. Add potatoes to the same boiling water and cook for 5 minutes. Drain, rinse in cold water, and transfer to a bowl. Drain the cauliflower and add to the potatoes. Set them aside.

Place apple, garlic, ginger, and chili (if using) in a food processor and process until minced but not pureed. Set aside.

Heat a large heavy pot over medium heat, add oil or butter. Add onions and reserved apple mixture and cook until the vegetables are softened and starting to color, 5 to 7 minutes. Add curry powder and flour. Cook for 3-5 minutes to lightly brown the curry powder and flour. Add coconut milk, stock, and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, then add cauliflower and potatoes, chickpeas. Reduce the heat to medium, cover, and cook 15 minutes. Stir in spinach, cover, and cook until wilted, about 3 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve over hot cooked rice.

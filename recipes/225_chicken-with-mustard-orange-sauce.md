Adapted from [Epicurious](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Chicken-Thighs-with-Creole-Mustard-Orange-Sauce-5665#ixzz0oISbUgvt)

**Serves:** 2

 

**Preparation Time:** 30 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   4 small chicken thighs
-   3/4 cup orange juice
-   3/4 cup chicken broth
-   1/4 cup creole or whole grain Dijon mustard
-   1 Tablespoon honey
-   1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce

 

**Instructions:**

 

Sprinkle chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. Heat oil in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and sauté until brown, about 6 minutes per side. Add orange juice and broth to skillet. Simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Transfer chicken to plate. Add mustard, honey and pepper sauce to skillet. Increase heat and boil until sauce thickens enough to coat spoon, whisking occasionally, about 7 minutes. Return chicken to skillet. Simmer until heated through, about 1 minute. Transfer chicken to plates; top with sauce and serve.

 

Note: This sauce may be made vegetarian by omitting the chicken and chicken broth, and using as a sauce over vegetables or rice instead. Just simmer orange juice and vegetable broth together in a pan for about 5 minutes. Add mustard, honey, and pepper sauce, and cook until sauce is thickened.

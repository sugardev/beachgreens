Saucy Chicken and Chard
=======================

**Serves:** 4

 

**Preparation Time:** 45 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   4 4oz. chicken breasts
-   salt and pepper
-   1 tsp. olive oil
-   1 large bunch chard, (leaves and stems separated and chopped)
-   2 cloves garlic
-   ¼ cup white wine (optional but good!)
-   1 tbsp. lemon juice
-   ¾ cup part-skim ricotta cheese
-   ¼ cup grated parmesan cheese
-   1 cup tomato sauce
-   ¼ cup mozzarella cheese

 

**Instructions:**

Heat oven to 375 degrees and line a baking sheet with foil. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. In a large skillet, heat the oil on high and cook the chicken breasts until brown on both sides, a couple of minutes per side (the chicken will not be fully cooked). Remove the chicken to the foil-lined baking sheet. Turn the stove to medium-low and add the chard leaves and stems and garlic. Cover and cook for 3 minutes, until leaves are wilted. Add wine, lemon juice, ricotta, and Parmesan to the pan and stir with the chard to combine. Top each chicken breast with ¼ of the chard/cheese mixture, then ¼ cup tomato sauce, then mozzarella. Bake until cheese browns and chicken is cooked through, about 20 minutes.

Braised Celery with Crunchy Bread Crumb Topping
===============================================

Adapted from [*All About Braising* by Molly Stevens](http://www.mollystevenscooks.com/books.php)

**Serves:** 4
 **Preparation Time:** 1 hour 45 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   2 tablespoons unsalted butter
-   1 head celery
-   1 large shallot, or small yellow onion, or 3 cloves garlic, finely minced
-   1½ teaspoons finely chopped fresh thyme, or ½ teaspoon dried
-   sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
-   ¼ cup dry white wine or dry white vermouth
-   1 cup chicken stock
-   3 to 4 tablespoons grated Gruyere or Swiss cheese
-   3 to 4 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese
-   3 to 4 tablespoons fresh bread crumbs, made from day old rustic white bread

 

**Instructions:**

Preheat the oven to 325°F. Using about half the butter, butter a large gratin dish or a baking dish. (9”X13” or 10”X14”)

Tear the outer larger celery stalks from the head. You want 10 to 12 sturdy outer stalks. Stop tearing off the stalks when you reach the shorter, paler stalks, or the heart. Set these aside. Rinse the larger celery stalks well. Trim off the top part of the stalk where it branches into leaves, and set aside with the heart. Scrape the outside of each celery stalk with a paring knife or a vegetable peeler, to remove fibrous strings. Cut the stalks into 3 to 4 inch lengths. Arrange them in a layer in the baking dish. It is okay if they overlap, they will shrink and flatten into one layer.

Finely chop the reserved celery heart, with the celery tops and leaves. Melt the remaining butter in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shallot or onion, thyme, and chopped celery heart and leaves. Season with salt and pepper. Saute, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are soft and beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Pour in the wine and simmer until the pan is almost dry, about 3 minutes. Add the stock and simmer until reduced by half, another 6 minutes or so.

Pour the celery-shallot-stock mixture over the celery sticks. Cover with foil and slide into the middle of the oven to braise until the celery has collapsed and feels very tender when prodded with a knife tip, about 1 hour and 15 minutes.

Remove the celery from the oven, and increase the oven heat to 400°F. Sprinkle the cheese and breadcrumbs over the celery, and return to the oven until the cheese is melted and the top is crusty and browned, about 10 more minutes. Serve hot or warm.

**Note:** *To make breadcrumbs, cut the thick crusts off day old bread. Bread should be dry and stale. If not, cut into cubes, and dry out in a 250°F oven. Toss cubes into food processor and pulse on and off until you are left with crumbs, some very fine, and some the size of peas. (If you have heated them in the oven, make sure you cool them before using the food processor.) If you don’t have a food processor, you may grate the stale bread on a box grater. Store the breadcrumbs in a sealed zip-lock bag in the freezer for a few weeks.*

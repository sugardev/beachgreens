========================

Adapted from [Epicurious](www.epicurious.com)

**Serves:** 2 (can be doubled)

**Preparation Time:** 25 minutes or less

**Ingredients:**

2 tablespoons (1/4 stick) butter

2 garlic cloves, minced

4 ounces red Swiss chard, stemmed, chopped (about 3 cups packed)

3/4 teaspoon hot pepper sauce

5 large eggs

3/4 cup grated sharp cheddar cheese

1/4 teaspoon salt

1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

**Instructions:**

Melt 1 tablespoon butter in 8-inch-diameter well seasoned cast-iron skillet over medium-low heat. Add garlic; saut√© until soft, about 2 minutes. Stir in chard, cover and cook until tender, about 4 minutes. Stir in hot sauce. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to small bowl. Wipe skillet clean.

Whisk eggs, 1/4 cup cheese, salt and pepper in medium bowl to blend. Melt 1/2 tablespoon butter in same skillet over medium-high heat. Add half of egg mixture and cook until eggs are just set in center, tilting pan and lifting edge of omelet with spatula to let uncooked portion flow underneath, about 2 minutes. Scatter half of chard mixture over half of omelet. Sprinkle 1/4 cup cheese over chard. Fold omelet over cheese; slide out onto plate. Repeat with remaining butter, egg mixture, chard and cheese.

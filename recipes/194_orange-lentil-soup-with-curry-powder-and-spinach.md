**Serves:** 8
 **Preparation Time:** 1 hour

**Ingredients:**

-   2 Tablespoons unsalted butter or ghee
-   1 medium onion, finely chopped
-   2 tablespoons tomato paste
-   1 Tablespoon good-quality sweet curry powder
-   1 teaspoon ground cumin
-   1/4 teaspoon cayenne (or up to 1/2 teaspoon)
-   2 bay leaves
-   2 cups orange lentils, picked over and rinsed
-   6 cups chicken or vegetable broth
-   1 14.5-oz can tomatoes, passed through a food mill
-   ½ pound potato, peeled and cubed (optional)
-   ½ pound spinach, washed well and cut into ribbons (or just torn into pieces)
-   Salt and pepper to taste

 

**Instructions:**

In a large soup pot, saute onion in butter until translucent. Add tomato paste, curry powder, cumin, and cayenne and stir until fragrant, 30 seconds to a minute. Add lentils, tomatoes, bay leaves, broth, and potato. Partially cover, bring to a boil, and cook until lentils and potato are tender, about 20-30 minutes, skimming off any foam that rises to the surface. Remove from heat and puree soup a bit with an immersion blender (but don't make it too smooth). Return to heat, stir in spinach and salt and pepper to taste, and cook for a minute or so until spinach is wilted into the soup.

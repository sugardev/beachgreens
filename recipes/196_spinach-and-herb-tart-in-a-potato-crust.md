Spinach and Herb Tart in a Potato Crust
=======================================

You may use a variety of greens for this dish—kale, chard, collards, beet greens. How long you cook them depends on how tough the green is, and how soft you like your greens.

**Serves:** 4-8
 **Preparation Time:** 35 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   3 large russet potatoes, about 1 1/4 pounds
-   2 tablespoons olive oil
-   1 bunch scallions, including greens, sliced
-   1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill
-   1/2 cup chopped parsley
-   1/2 cup chopped cilantro
-   2 bunches spinach, leaves only, coarsely chopped
-   2 eggs, beaten
-   1 cup small-curd cottage cheese
-   1/3 -1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
-   grated zest of one lemon
-   salt and freshly ground black pepper

 

**Instructions:**

Peel the potatoes. Slice two of them crosswise into 1/8" thick slices. Slice the third potato lengthwise into 1/8" thick slices. Heat a wide skillet over medium high heat and once hot, coat with a thin layer of olive oil. Reduce heat to medium and add potatoes in a single layer, being careful not to crowd the pan. Turn them once, until golden on both sides, and tender when pierced with a knife. Cook in batches until they are all done. Remove them to drain on a paper towel.

Add 1 tablespoon oil to the same pan. Add scallions, dill, parsley,and cilantro and cook over medium heat until the scallions are wilted and bright green. Season with salt and set aside in a bowl. Add the spinach to the same pan, add 1/4 cup of water if the leaves start to stick. Cook over high heat until the leaves are wilted and tender. Transfer the spinach to a sieve and press out any excess water, then add it to the scallions. Add the eggs, cheeses, and lemon zest and stir well. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

Preheat the oven to 375. To assemble the tart, lightly butter a springform pan and set it on a sheet pan. Cover the bottom with the potato rounds, overlapping where necessary so there are no empty spaces. Place the long pieces around the sides. Pour in the spinach mixture, then bake immediately until firm and golden in places, about 40 minutes. Gently ease a knife between the edge of the pan and the potatoes. Release the spring and carefully lift off the side. Set on a serving plate. Can be served warm, or at room temperature.

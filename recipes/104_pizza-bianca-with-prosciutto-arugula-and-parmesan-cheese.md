Pizza Bianca with Prosciutto, Arugula, and Parmesan Cheese
==========================================================

**Serves:** 2-3

 

**Preparation Time:** 1 hour

**Ingredients:**

-   1 bag refrigerated pizza dough (I like the stuff from Trader Joe’s)
-   2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
-   8 thin slices prosciutto (about 3 ounces)
-   1 cup (packed) arugula leaves
-   1 cup fresh Parmesan shavings (about 2 ounces)

 

**Instructions:**

Preheat oven to 500°F. Flour large baking sheet. Remove pizza dough from bag and let come to room temperature. Roll out on floured sheet. Drizzle pizza with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Bake until crusts are brown, about 8 minutes. Using metal spatula, loosen crusts from baking sheets.

Transfer pizza crusts to plates. Top each with prosciutto, arugula, and Parmesan, dividing equally. Drizzle each with 1/2 tablespoon olive oil and serve immediately.

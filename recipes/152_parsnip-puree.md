Parsnip Puree
=============

Adapted from [Food Network](http://foodnetwork.com)

**Serves:** 4 as a side
 **Preparation Time:** 1 hour 15 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   1 bunch parsnips, tops removed, peeled and sliced about 1/3-inch thick
-   1 – 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
-   2 to 3 tablespoons unsalted butter cut into bits
-   Salt and freshly ground white pepper to taste

 

**Instructions:**

In a saucepan, combine the parsnips and salt and enough water to just cover them. Bring to a boil and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes or until tender and two thirds of the water has evaporated. Using a food mill fitted with the fine blade or a food processor, puree the mixture and return it to the saucepan. Beat in the butter, and season with salt and freshly ground white pepper to taste. Set the pan over another containing simmering water, cover and let cook for 20 to 30 minutes more. (The parsnip puree improves in flavor with this additional cooking.)

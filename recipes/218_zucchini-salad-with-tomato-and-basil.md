====================================

Adapted from [Kalyn's Kitchen](http://kalynskitchen.blogspot.com/2007/07/zucchini-salad-recipe-with-tomato-and.html)

**Serves:** 2
 **Preparation Time:** 45 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   1 or 2 medium zucchini, washed and sliced in slices slightly less than 1/2 inch thick
-   kosher salt, for drawing water out of zucchini
-   3-4 ripe tomatoes, sliced 1/2 inch thick
-   1/4 cup basil, cut into thin chiffonade (about 12 large basil leaves)
-   sea salt to taste
-   1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
-   2 Tablespoons balsamic vinegar

Â 

**Instructions:**

Wash zucchini and slice slightly less than 1/2 inch thick, then put in colander in single layer. Sprinkle on a generous amount of salt and let sit for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, shake off each zucchini slice and wipe dry with a paper towel.

While zucchini drains, slice tomatoes and chiffonade basil. Whisk together olive oil and balsamic vinegar.

To arrange salad, make a layer of zucchini slices on the plate, then a layer of tomato slices. Get creative here with the arrangement, depending on how big your zucchini and tomato slices are in proportion to each other.

Drizzle a generous amount of balsamic vinaigrette over each salad. You may not need all the dressing. Season with sea salt, then sprinkle with basil strips and serve immediately. Be sure to get some of the zucchini, tomato, basil, and vinaigrette in each bite.

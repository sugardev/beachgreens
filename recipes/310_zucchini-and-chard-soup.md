Zucchini and Chard Soup
=======================

Adapted from [Here](http://www.notonlypizza.com/2009/06/24/zucchini-and-swiss-chard-soup/)

 

**Serves:** 4

 

**Preparation Time:** 30 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   4 Tbsp. extra virgin olive oil
-   1 cup finely chopped white onion, or 3 leeks, white part only, sliced
-   1 bunch Swiss chard, thinly sliced, stems removed and chopped as well
-   3-4 medium zucchini coarsely grated
-   1/4 tsp. turmeric powder
-   2 tsp. sea salt
-   4 cups vegetable broth
-   4 slices of whole wheat bread for topping (optional)
-   1 Tbsp. extra virgin olive oil

 

**Instructions:**

**For the croutons:**

 

Eliminate the bread crust, and cut the slices in cubes. Drizzle 1 Tablespoon olive oil in a pan, and add the cubed bread. Toast the cubes until golden brown.

 

**For the soup:**

 

Warm up the oil in a pot, then add the onions and chopped swiss chard stems, and sauté them until tender, about 7 minutes.

 

In the meantime grate the zucchini, and add them to the onions. Cook them for 5 minutes. When the zucchini are getting soft, add the Swiss chard leaves, 4 cups broth, the turmeric, and cook for 3 more minutes.

 

Blend the soup until creamy. If the soup is too thick, add some more broth. If it’s too liquid, let it simmer until it reaches the desired consistency.

 

Serve your soup topped with croutons, if you like.

 

**Note:**

 

\* If you want a richer soup, substitute 1 cup vegetable broth with 1 cup heavy cream or whole milk.

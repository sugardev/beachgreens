Sauteed Celery Root
===================

All root vegetables can be sautéed. However, because of their density they must be cut into thin slices or a small dice. If not, the exteriors will burn before the center is cooked.

**Serves:** 2-3
 **Preparation Time:** 25 minutes or less

**Ingredients:**

-   1 large celery root
-   1 Tablespoon (or more) olive oil
-   1 Tablespoon unsalted butter as needed
-   1 Tablespoon cognac
-   2 Tablespoons heavy cream (optional)
-   Salt and pepper to taste

 

**Instructions:**

Peel and cut the celery root into a small dice. Heat a sauté pan over medium-high heat and add a combination of olive oil and butter. Cook until the celery root is just soft, and starting to stick a little. Deglaze the pan with of cognac and add cream at the very end. Season with salt and pepper. Variation: Place the diced celery root in a sauté pan with butter and a teaspoon of sugar. Add enough water to come halfway up the vegetable. Simmer until the celery root is soft and the water and sugar have reduced to a syrupy glaze, about fifteen minutes. Finish with herbs of your choice, salt and pepper.

=====================

This rustic soup is quick and simple to prepare.

 

**Serves:** 4

 

**Preparation Time:** 30 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   1 pound broccoli
-   1½ tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
-   ½ large onion, finely chopped
-   1 1/4 quarts chicken or vegetable stock
-   1/2 tablespoon lemon juice, or to taste
-   salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
-   Baguette or other rustic bread
-   1 large garlic clove, cut in half
-   freshly grated Parmesan cheese (optional)

 

**Instructions:**

Using a sharp small knife or vegetable peeler, peel the broccoli stems. Chop the stem and florets into small chunks.

In a 4 to 6 quart pot, heat olive oil. Add onion and cook until beginning to soften. Add broccoli and cook until it starts to turn bright green. Add stock, bring to a boil, and simmer until broccoli is soft, about 10 minutes. Once soft, puree with a stick blender until partially pureed. If using a regular blender, remove half of the soup, puree, and add back to the pot. Season with lemon juice, salt and pepper. Reheat.

To serve, toast 2 to 3 slices of bread for each bowl. Rub toast with garlic clove, and place bread in the bottom of each soup bowl. Spoon soup over the bread. Sprinkle with Parmesan, if desired.

=============================

Adapted from [All Recipes](http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/green-beans-with-bread-crumbs/detail.aspx)

 

I made this for dinner last week, and it was my 3-year-old daughter’s FAVORITE throughout the week. I think she probably ate the entire pound of greens beans over the week. The crunch and flavor on this is delicious, and it’s so simple!

**Serves:** 4

 

**Preparation Time:** 25 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   1 pound fresh green beans, washed and trimmed
-   1/2 cup water
-   1/4 cup bread crumbs
-   1/4 cup olive oil
-   salt and pepper to taste
-   1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
-   1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
-   1/4 teaspoon dried basil
-   1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

 

**Instructions:**

 

Combine green beans and 1/2 cup water in a medium pot. Cover, and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium, and let beans cook for 10 minutes, or until tender. Drain well.

 

Place beans in a medium serving bowl, and mix in bread crumbs, olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic powder, oregano and basil. Toss mixture until the beans are coated. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, and serve.

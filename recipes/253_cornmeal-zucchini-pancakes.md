Cornmeal Zucchini Pancakes
==========================

Adapted from [Root Simple](http://www.rootsimple.com/2011/07/cornmeal-zucchini-pancakes.html)

 

**Preparation Time:** 25 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   1 1/4 cup cornmeal
-   3/4 cup all purpose flour
-   2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
-   1 tablespoon of sugar
-   3/4 teaspoon salt
-   1 egg
-   1 cup of milk
-   2 tablespoons of vegetable oil
-   1 cup of grated zucchini, yellow or green, or yellow summer squash
-   3 tablespoons finely chopped onion

 

**Instructions:**

In a big bowl fork together the dry ingredients (the first 5 ingredients). In a smaller bowl mix the wet ingredients (the next 5 ingredients). Dump wet ingredients on top of the dry and mix just until incorporated.

 

Cook these like any pancake: in a greased skillet over medium heat until they're golden brown and the sides are firm. Keep the finished ones warm in the oven while you cook the rest.

 

They keep well in the fridge.

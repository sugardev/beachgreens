Grapefruit Avocado Salad
========================

**Serves:**2-3
 **Preparation Time:** 20 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   2 medium Ruby Red grapefruits
-   1-2 teaspoons white wine vinegar
-   Salt and pepper, to taste
-   3 tablespoons fruity olive oil
-   1 ripe avocado

Â 

**Instructions:**

With a serrated knife, cut the top and bottom off each grapefruit. Set a grapefruit on a cutting board flat side down. Working from top to bottom, cut away the white rind and pith so you see the juicy flesh. Cut between the sections to remove the tough membranes. Put the sections into a large bowl; squeeze in any remaining juice from the membranes. Continue with the other 2 grapefruit.

In a small bowl, whisk the vinegar, salt, and pepper. Whisk in the oil a little at a time; set aside.

Cut the avocado in half, remove the pits, and scoop out the flesh with a large spoon. Place the halves, cut sides down, on a board. Cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch slices.

On a large platter, arrange the grapefruit segments and avocado slices in clusters. Spoon the dressing over the fruit.

Pink Lady Apple Crisp
=====================

**Serves**: 3-4

 

**Preparation Time**: 1 1/2 hours

**Ingredients**:

-   2 pink lady apples
-   1 Tablespoon unsalted butter
-   1 Tablespoon brown sugar
-   1 Tablespoon freshly squeezed orange juice
-   1/2 stick butter; very cold and cubed
-   1/4 cup brown sugar
-   1/4 cup all-purpose flour
-   1/4 cup good quality oats
-   1 teaspoon cinnamon

 

**Instructions**:

Cut the apples into slices and cook in a pan for about 10 minutes with the 1 Tablespoon butter, brown sugar, and orange juice. Cook just long enough to get a good thick consistency to the butter - you don’t want mushy apples.

Meanwhile, make the topping. Put ½ stick butter, ¼ cup brown sugar, flour, oats, and cinnamon in a bowl and mix with fingers. Just mix it long enough to incorporate everything, but don’t overdo it, you want big chunks. Put the apple mix into a buttered dish and cover with topping. Bake for about 40 minutes at 375 or until brown.

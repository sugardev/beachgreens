**Serves:** 2

Â 

**Preparation Time:** 15 minutes

-   1 fennel bulb, washed, trimmed (about 6-7 oz.), thickly sliced (about 2 cups)
-   2 med. ripe Fuyu persimmons (about 8 oz. total), washed, sliced (about 2 cups)
-   1 tsp. fennel leaves, finely chopped
-   1 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil
-   1-2 tsp. grated orange peel
-   Juice of 1 orange (about 1/2 cup)
-   2 tsp. balsamic vinegar
-   1/8 tsp. salt

**Instructions:**

Prepare the vinaigrette by mixing the oil, orange peel, orange juice, vinegar, and salt together in a salad bowl. Then slice the bottom off the fennel bulb, reserving some of the green leaves. Remove the tough outer leaves from the bulb. Then quarter and slice the bulb as thinly as possible. Chop finely a teaspoon or two of the reserved green fennel leaves. Place the fennel bulb and leaves in a salad bowl and toss immediately to coat all surfaces with the vinaigrette dressing.Then cut a small amount off the top and bottom of the persimmons. Slice each persimmon (skin and all) into 1/4 inch thick rounds and then into quarters. Add the persimmons to the salad bowl and toss gently to coat all pieces of persimmon with the dressing. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed. You may want slightly more orange peel, orange juice, and/or balsamic vinegar. Also, if your orange is not very sweet, you may want to add a pinch or two of sugar.

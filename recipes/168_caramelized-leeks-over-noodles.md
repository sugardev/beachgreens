Caramelized Leeks over Noodles
==============================

**Serves:** 2
 **Preparation Time:** 30 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   2 medium leeks
-   1/2 Tablespoon olive oil
-   1 Tablespoon unsalted butter
-   1/2 Tablespoon dark brown soft sugar
-   5 ounces noodles or pasta of your choice
-   2 heaping Tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
-   1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil
-   Salt and black pepper to taste

Â 

**Instructions:**

Split the leeks lengthways and wash each layer thoroughly. Slice across into thin strips, including the green part. Heat the olive and butter together over a gentle heat. When the butter has melted, add the leeks and toss well. Cook slowly, uncovered, for about 10 minutes or until the leeks start to soften.

Sprinkle over the sugar. After a couple more minutes, mix well. Continue to cook for 15 to 30 minutes, until the leeks have begun to collapse into a sticky mass. Add small amounts of hot water if required to stop sticking.

While the leeks are cooking, cook and drain the noodles. When the leeks are done, add the parsley, olive oil, cooked noodles and seasoning to taste. Toss well and serve.

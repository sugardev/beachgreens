Celery Root Salad with Apples and Walnuts
=========================================

**Serves:** 2-3
 **Preparation Time:** 30 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   1 celery root, peeled and cut into matchsticks
-   1 apple, cored, quartered, and cut into slivers
-   ½ cup walnuts, toasted

 

**Vinaigrette**

-   2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
-   1 shallot, finely diced
-   1 garlic clove, minced
-   salt and freshly ground black pepper
-   1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
-   1 tablespoon plain yogurt or sour cream
-   ¼ cup extra virgin olive oil

 

**Instructions:**

Make vinaigrette first by combining the first 7 ingredients.

To cut celery root into matchsticks, peel the celery root as described below, and cut into 1/8” rounds. Stack these slices and cut them into long thin strips. Cook the celery root strips in a pot of salted boiling water for 3-4 minutes, until just soft. Drain and rinse with cold water. Toss with apple, vinaigrette and walnuts. Try serving over a bed of greens.

**Variation**: *Use hazelnuts and hazelnut oil instead of walnuts and olive oil. Also try walnut oil.*

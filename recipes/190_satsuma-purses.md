Satsuma Purses
==============

by Myriam Joseph

**Serves:** 4

 

**Preparation Time:** 45 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   4 satsuma tangerines
-   8-10 sheets of Filo pastry, depending on size
-   4 oz. unsalted butter, melted
-   12 oz. plain or milk chocolate, roughly chopped

 

**Instructions:**

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Peel the satsuma and divide it into segments.

Cut the filo pastry sheets into 4-inch squares with scissors, then keep it covered with a layer of plastic wrap, topped with a tea-towel wrung out in cold water, to prevent it drying out.

Take two of the filo squares and brush each one with melted butter. Lay on top of each other. Place about one-sixth of the chocolate in the centre, then top that with a few satsuma segments.

Gently gather the filo pastry edges up around the chocolate and satsuma and twist together to form a little filo purse.

Place the filled filo purse on a buttered baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.

Bake for around 8-10 minutes until golden brown.Serve warm from the oven.

Jicama—What is it? Adapted from: http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-jicama.htm Jicama is a crispy, sweet, edible root that resembles a turnip in physical appearance, although the plants are not related. Jicama has been cultivated in South America for centuries, and the vegetable is quite popular in Mexican cuisine. Jicama has a unique flavor that lends itself well to salads, salsas, and vegetable platters. Before eating, the coarse brown outer layer of the jicama should be peeled to reveal the white inside.

Barley and Mushroom 'Risotto'
=============================

Adapted from [Joy of Cooking](http://www.thejoykitchen.com/default.lasso)

**Serves:** 4
 **Preparation Time:** 1 1/2 hours

**Ingredients:**

-   4 to 6 Tablespoons unsalted butter
-   1 1/3 cups finely chopped onions
-   8 oz. shiitake mushrooms, stems removed and caps diced
-   1 cup pearl barley
-   2/3 cup dry white wine
-   1 Tablespoon mashed or finely minced garlic
-   pinch salt
-   ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
-   6 cups chicken (or vegetable) stock
-   ½-1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

 

**Instructions:**

Heat butter in a large deep skillet over medium heat. Add onion, and cook, stirring, until tender but not brown. Add mushrooms and cook until softened. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and stir in barley. Add wine, garlic, salt and pepper, and cook until liquid is absorbed.

H

ave stock in a separate saucepan on the side, set to a simmer. Stir 2 cups of stock into the barley, and simmer slowly, stirring, until the stock is almost absorbed. Add the remaining stock ½ cup at a time, allowing each addition to be absorbed before adding the next. The barley needs 45-60 minutes to cook to become very tender. If you run low on stock while the barley is still very underdone, reduce the heat. If you do run out of stock, finish cooking with hot water. Stir in Parmesan cheese just before serving.

This risotto can be made 4 days ahead, to reheat, put in a skillet over low heat, adding a little water and stirring frequently.

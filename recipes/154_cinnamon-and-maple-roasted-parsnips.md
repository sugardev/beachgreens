Cinnamon and Maple Roasted Parsnips
===================================

This makes the fluffiest parsnips, because you peel them after they have been partially cooked in water. Oven time is 40 minutes.

**Serves:** 4
 **Preparation Time:** 1 hour

**Ingredients:**

-   1 pound same-sized medium parsnips
-   3-4 Tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
-   ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
-   1 Tablespoon maple syrup

 

**Instructions:**

Heat the oven to 350°F. Scrub the parsnips clean and drop whole into a saucepan filled with boiling water. Boil for 10 minutes or until half cooked, drain, then allow to cool. Once they are warm, but not hot, top and tail them. Cut each in half lengthways, then peel off the skin with a small knife. (It winds off easily if you peel around the parsnip. Don’t peel it lengthways.) Cut lengthways into wedges.

Melt the butter with the cinnamon and maple syrup. Place the parsnips in a roasting pan and mix in the spicy sweet butter. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then place in the oven for 40 minutes, turning regularly until soft and golden-flecked.

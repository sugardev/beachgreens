Fennel-Arugula Salad with Feta Cheese
=====================================

Adapted from:http://www.self.com/fooddiet/recipes/2009/11/fennel-arugula-salad

 

I found this recipe to be very adaptable. I've made it without fennel, but added feta cheese. I didn't have any shallot, so I used regular onion, but it can also be left out. Delicious!

**Serves:** 4

 

**Preparation Time:** 20 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   5 cups arugula
-   1 medium bulb fennel, thinly sliced into half-moons (optional)
-   2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
-   2 tablespoons orange juice
-   2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
-   1 tablespoon finely chopped shallot
-   1/2 teaspoon finely grated orange zest
-   1/4 teaspoon salt
-   1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
-   1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese (optional)

 

**Instructions:**

Toss arugula and fennel in a salad bowl. Whisk oil, juice, vinegar, shallot, zest, salt and pepper in another bowl. Pour over fennel and arugula; toss to coat. Sprinkle feta on top on serve!

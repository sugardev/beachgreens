**Serves:** 4

 

**Preparation Time:** 35 minutes

Ingredients:

-   1 (1 1/2-pound) butternut squash, peeled and 3/4-inch) diced
-   Good olive oil
-   1 tablespoon pure maple syrup
-   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
-   3 tablespoons dried cranberries
-   3/4 cup apple cider or apple juice
-   2 tablespoons cider vinegar
-   2 tablespoons minced shallots (if you don’t have this, leave it out, or use a little onion)
-   2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
-   4 ounces baby arugula, washed and spun dry (you may also substitute other greens)
-   1/2 cup walnuts halves, toasted
-   3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan

 

**Instructions:** Place the butternut squash on a sheet pan. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil, the maple syrup, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and toss. Roast the squash for 15 to 20 minutes, turning once, until tender. Add the cranberries to the pan for the last 5 minutes.

 

While the squash is roasting, combine the apple cider, vinegar, and shallots in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook for 6 to 8 minutes, until the cider is reduced to about 1/4 cup. Off the heat, whisk in the mustard, 1/2 cup olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper.

 

Place the arugula in a large salad bowl and add the roasted squash mixture, the walnuts, and the grated Parmesan. Spoon just enough vinaigrette over the salad to moisten and toss well. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and serve immediately.

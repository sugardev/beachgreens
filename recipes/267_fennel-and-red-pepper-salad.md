Adapted from: [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/10/health/nutrition/10recipehealth.html)

 

**Serves:** 3

 

**Preparation Time:** 20 minutes

-   1 fennel bulb, washed, trimmed, thinly sliced (about 2 cups)
-   1/2 large red bell pepper
-   1 Tablespoon minced parsley (or 1/2 teaspoon dried)
-   1 Tablespoon minced chives (optional, or can be replaced by 1 teaspoon of minced onion)
-   1/2 oz. shaved parmesan
-   1 Tablespoon fresh lemon juice
-   1/2 Tablespoon sherry vinegar or champagne vinegar
-   1/2 small garlic clove, minced
-   1/8 cup extra virgin olive oil

**Instructions:**

Combine the salad ingredients in a large bowl. Whisk together the lemon juice, vinegar, garlic, salt, pepper and olive oil. Toss with the salad and serve.

Advance preparation: This is a great keeper. The vegetables marinate in the dressing, and they don’t get soggy, just saturated and extremely tasty.

Cabbage Salad with Carrot and Fennel
====================================

**With the help of a food processor shredding attachment, this recipe is done in minutes!**

 

**Serves:** 6

 

**Preparation Time:** 45 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   1 head green cabbage, shredded
-   1 ½ Tablespoons salt
-   2-3 carrots, shredded
-   1 fennel bulb, core removed and shredded
-   ¼ onion, shredded
-   Juice of 1 lemon
-   Olive oil to taste
-   Freshly Ground Black Pepper
-   Fresh Mint, if you have it

 

**Instructions:**

Combine the cabbage in a colander with salt. Work with your hands to get salt distributed evenly. Cover with a plate that fits in the colander, and place something heavy on top. Make sure the colander is in the sink, the cabbage is going to weep some liquid. While you’re doing this, prepare other ingredients. Taste the cabbage in the colander. It should taste salty, even over salty. Don’t worry, you will combine it with other ingredients. If it’s over the top salty, rinse it a bit. Combine the cabbage, carrots, fennel and onion in a bowl. Add the lemon juice, olive oil, pepper, and mint if using. This salad tastes best if it sits for at least ½ hour, refrigerated, before eating.

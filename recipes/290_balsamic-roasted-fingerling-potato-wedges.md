=========================================

Adapted from [Group Recipes](http://www.grouprecipes.com/41464/balsamic-roasted-fingerling-potato-wedges.html)

**Serves**: 3-4

 

**Preparation Time**: 30 minutes

**Ingredients**:

-   1 ¼ pounds of fingerling potatoes, washed and halved
-   2 ½ tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
-   1 tablespoon sea salt
-   ½ teaspoon fresh ground pepper
-   1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, chopped fine (optional)
-   2 to 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar

 

**Instructions**:

Preheat your oven to 450 degrees. Place your oven rack in the lower third of your oven.

 

Prepare your potato wedges. Attempt to cut each wedge into similar sizes for even roasting.

 

Toss the wedges in a bowl with the olive oil, sea salt, pepper and rosemary (optional).

 

Roast for 20 to 25 minutes, until fork tender.

 

Sprinkle with the balsamic vinegar, shaking the pan to coat the potatoes. Roast until vinegar evaporates, about 4 minutes.

 

Season with more sea salt and pepper and serve.

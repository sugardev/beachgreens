Baby Bok Choy with Cashews and Chili Flakes
===========================================

**Serves:** 4

 

**Preparation Time:** 30 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   2 Tablespoons olive oil
-   1 cup chopped leeks, white and tender green parts
-   1 pound baby bok choy, rinsed, larger leaves separated from base, base trimmed but still present, holding the smaller leaves together
-   1/2 teaspoon dark sesame oil
-   Salt
-   pinch (or more to taste) chili flakes
-   1/2 cup chopped, roasted, salted cashews

 

**Instructions:**

Heat olive oil in a large sauté pan on medium high heat. Add leeks, then bok choy. Sprinkle with sesame oil, salt, and chili flakes. Cover, and let the baby bok choy cook down for approximately 3 minutes. (Like spinach, when cooked, the bok choy will wilt a bit.)

Remove cover. Lower heat to low. Stir and let cook for a minute or two longer, until the bok choy is just cooked.

Gently mix in cashews.

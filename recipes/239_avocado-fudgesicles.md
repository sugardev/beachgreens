Avocado Fudgesicles
===================

Adapted from [The Whole Life Nutrition Kitchen](http://www.nourishingmeals.com/2010/06/avocado-fudgesicles.html)

Ingredients:

-   8 medjool dates, pitted
-   1/2 cup water
-   3 medium avocados, pitted
-   1 cup coconut milk
-   1/4 cup honey
-   5-7 Tablespoons cacao or cocoa powder
-   2 teaspoons vanilla
-   pinch sea salt

Â 

**Instructions:**

Place the dates into your blender and cover with the 1/2 cup water. Pack the dates down if needed so they are covered, for the most part, in the water. Let soak for about 30 minutes. Then add in the remaining ingredients and blend until very smooth and creamy. Depending on your blender, you may need to add a little extra coconut milk or water. Pour into small bowls and serve as pudding or pour into popsicle molds and freeze for at least 6 hours. Run under hot water to release.

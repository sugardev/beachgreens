========================

Adapted from [Traditional Foods](http://www.traditional-foods.com/recipes/butternut-squash-custard/)

 

**Serves:** 6

 

**Preparation Time:** 1 hour and 20 minutes (mostly cooking time)

**Ingredients:**

-   1 cup butternut squash puree
-   2/3 cup sucanat or brown sugar
-   2 lightly beaten eggs
-   1/4 teaspoon each: salt, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg
-   1 cup heavy whipping cream
-   2 tablespoons orange marmalade

 

**Instructions:**

Butter six custard cups and place in a large baking dish with sides. Mix all of the ingredients in a bowl in the order given. Ladle the mixture into the custard cups using a soup ladle. Pour hot water into the baking dish so it comes almost to the level of the custard mix in the cups.

 

Carefully place the whole business into a 350 degree oven and bake for 50 to 60 minutes. To test for doneness, slide a sharp knife into one of the custards. The knife will come out clean when the custard is done. If knife is not clean, bake for another ten minutes and re-test. Custards will have a dark top, almost crusty in texture and tasting a bit of caramel. The inside will be soft and delicate.

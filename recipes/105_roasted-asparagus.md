**Serves:** 3 to 4
 **Preparation Time:** 15 minutes

Ingredients:

-   1 bunch asparagus
-   salt and freshly ground black pepper
-   3 to 6 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil or unsalted butter
-   2 tablespoon finely chopped fresh herbs
-   minced garlic or onion (optional)
-   fresh lemon juice or champagne vinegar (optional)

Â 

**Instructions:**

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

To clean asparagus, rinse and break off the tough ends of each stalk by hand. Each stalk will break off between the tough and soft part.

In a large glass baking dish, toss the asparagus with the olive oil and garlic or onion, if using. Season lightly with salt and pepper, and toss. Bake until the asparagus are tender and lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes, depending upon the thickness of the stalks, stirring twice.

Remove from the oven and toss with the lemon juice or vinegar. Adjust the seasoning, to taste.

Serve warm or at room temperature.

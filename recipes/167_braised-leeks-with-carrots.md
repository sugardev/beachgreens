Braised Leeks with Carrots
==========================

When the weather turns cold, it’s comforting to have a pot of slowly cooking food on the stove.

**Serves:** 4-6 as a side dish

 

**Preparation Time:** 45 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   5 tablespoons unsalted butter
-   1 ½ pounds leeks, cut into 2” pieces
-   1 bay leaf
-   1 ½ pounds carrots, cut into chunks
-   5 tablespoons water
-   ½ cup white wine
-   a pinch of sugar
-   salt and freshly ground black pepper
-   2 tablespoons fresh mint or parsley, or other herb of your choice

 

**Instructions:**

Melt butter in large sauté pan over medium heat. Add leeks and cook over medium low heat until leeks start to soften. Add bay leaf, carrots, water, and white wine. Cook over medium-low heat until carrots are just soft all the way through, and wine has evaporated. Turn off heat, stir in sugar. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to serving platter, and sprinkle with fresh herbs.

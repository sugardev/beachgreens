**Serves:** 4

 

**Preparation Time:** 30 minutes or less

**Ingredients:**

-   1 to 1 1/2 pounds broccoli florets
-   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
-   4 slices firm white bread, crusts removed
-   6 tablespoons butter

 

**Instructions:**

Place the broccoli florets in a vegetable steamer basket. Pour about 3/4-inch water into a large saucepan. Place the steamer basket in the pan, bring the water to a simmer over medium-high heat, and cover. Steam for 5 minutes, or until the broccoli is crisp-tender. Transfer to a serving bowl and season with salt and pepper.

Meanwhile, place the center of the bread into a food processor and pulse to make bread crumbs. In a small saucepan, heat butter on medium high until butter turns a nutty brown color. Add the bread crumbs and toss in the butter. Pour the buttered crumbs onto the broccoli and toss to coat.

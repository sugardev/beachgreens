**Serves:** 6-8

 

**Preparation Time:** 15 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   1 cup peeled and chopped zucchini
-   ¼ cup lemon juice
-   2 Tablespoons olive oil
-   3 cloves garlic
-   1 teaspoon sea salt
-   ½ teaspoon paprika
-   ½ teaspoon ground cumin
-   Pinch of cayenne pepper
-   ½ cup raw tahini paste
-   2 teaspoons minced parsley
-   Za’atar seasoning, paprika, olive oil, and pine nuts for garnish

 

**Instructions:**

Place zucchini, lemon juice, oil, garlic, salt, paprika, cumin and cayenne in a blender and process until smooth. Add the tahini and blend again until well incorporated. Transfer to a bowl and stir in the minced parsley. Garnish with the za’atar seasoning, paprika, olive oil, and pine nuts. Chill for 2 hours. The hummus will keep for 3 days in the refrigerator.

 

Nutrition Note: Tahini is made of ground sesame seeds and is used in many Middle Eastern dishes. Sesame seeds are a great source of B vitamins and calcium, which are even more bioavailable when ground into tahini paste. Two tablespoons of tahini contains almost 35 percent of your recommended daily calcium intake.

 

Chef’s Tip: Za’atar is a popular Middle Eastern seasoning made of dried thyme, oregano, marjoram, sesame seeds, and other spices. It’s not essential for this dish, but provides an authentic touch.

Sauteed Rapini
==============

Unlike broccoli that you can sauté directly in a frying pan, rapini needs to be steamed or boiled before frying to ease the bitterness. That was definitely a “trial by error” lesson learned.

**Serves:** 2-3

 

**Preparation Time:** 20 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   1 bunch rapini
-   1 teaspoon salt
-   1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
-   2 cloves of garlic
-   4-6 T of olive oil

 

**Instructions:**

Place rapini in a pot and just cover with water. Add salt, and cook until the stalks are crisp tender, about 5 minutes. Drain.

In a medium hot frying pan, heat olive oil and garlic (crushed/chopped) until fragrant. Add drained rapini and sauté slightly - let the stalks get browned. Cook until the rapini flowers are slightly crispy and browned. Add salt and pepper as required.

Adapted from [Food Network](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/giada-de-laurentiis/beet-and-goat-cheese-arugula-salad-recipe/index.html)

 

**Serves:** 2-3

 

**Preparation Time:** 45 minutes (this includes beet cooking time, which may be done ahead)

**Ingredients:**

-   1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
-   1 tablespoon honey
-   1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
-   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
-   3 medium beets, peeled and quartered
-   2 cups fresh arugula
-   1/4 cup walnuts, toasted, coarsely chopped
-   1 fennel bulb, tops and core removed, thinly sliced
-   1/4 cup dried cranberries or dried cherries
-   1/2 avocado, peeled, pitted, and cubed (optional)
-   2-3 ounces soft fresh goat cheese, coarsely crumbled

 

**Instructions:**

Line a baking sheet with foil. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

 

Whisk the vinegar and honey in a medium bowl to blend. Gradually whisk in the oil. Season the vinaigrette, to taste, with salt and pepper. Toss the beets in a small bowl with enough dressing to coat. Place the beets on the prepared baking sheet and roast until the beets are slightly caramelized, stirring occasionally, about 20-25 minutes. Set aside and cool.

 

Toss the arugula, walnuts, fennel and cranberries in a large bowl with enough vinaigrette to coat. Season the salad, to taste, with salt and pepper. Arrange the beets around the salad. Sprinkle with the avocado and goat cheese, and serve.

Roasted and Shredded Brussels Sprouts with Almonds and Parmesan
===============================================================

Adapted from [Kalyns Kitchen](http://www.kalynskitchen.com/2009/11/recipe-for-shredded-and-roasted.html)

**Serves:** 2-3

 

**Preparation Time:** 1 hour

**Ingredients:**

-   1 pound Brussels Sprouts
-   1 1/2 Tablespoons olive oil plus about 1 teaspoon for brushing roasting pan
-   1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
-   salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste
-   1-2 Tablespoons coarsely grated Parmesan cheese
-   1-2 Tablespoons toasted slivered almonds (could use other types of nuts as well)

 

**Instructions:**

Preheat oven to 400 F. Trim the stem end from Brussels sprouts, then cut them crosswise into thin strips about 3/8 inch wide. (I used the food processor with a 6mm slicing blade, but some sprouts got sliced the wrong way and didn't separate, and next time I'd slice them crosswise with a knife.) Put shredded sprouts into a bowl. Whisk together the olive oil and balsamic vinegar, then toss the Brussels sprouts with the oil-vinegar mixture and season with a generous amount of fresh ground black pepper and some salt.

 

Brush a roasting pan with 1 tsp. of olive oil and arrange the Brussels sprouts on the pan in a single layer. Roast until the Brussels sprouts are nicely browned on the edges and tender, about 25 minutes. I turned them about every 10 minutes.

 

During the last few minutes of roasting time, put almonds in a dry pan and toast 1-2 minutes, shaking the pan so they don't burn. Don't walk away because they go from nicely browned to burned in a few seconds.

 

Wipe out the bowl you used to toss the raw Brussels sprouts in, and when they are cooked through and browned as much as you'd like, toss the hot sprouts with the coarsely grated Parmesan. Arrange on serving dish, sprinkle almonds over and serve.

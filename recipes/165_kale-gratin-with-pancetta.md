**Serves:** 2-3
 **Preparation Time:** 30 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   1 bunch kale, stems stripped and chopped
-   Salt
-   2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
-   1/4 pound pancetta, chopped into 1/2-inch pieces
-   3/4 cup cream
-   ½ onion, minced
-   1/8 teaspoon grated nutmeg, eyeball it
-   Black pepper
-   1/2 cup breadcrumbs
-   1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or Pecorino Romano

 

**Instructions:**

Preheat the broiler but place the oven rack on the second shelf down from the heat source.

Bring a few inches of water to a boil in a deep skillet or pot, add the kale and salt and cook 5 to 6 minutes; drain and dry the greens.

Return the skillet to the stove over medium-high heat and add 1 tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil and pancetta. Crisp the pancetta and add the cream and onion. Season with nutmeg, salt, and pepper then reduce 7 to 8 minutes to about 1/2 to 2/3 cup. Add cooked greens to cream and stir to coat evenly. Transfer to shallow casserole.

Toss with breadcrumbs with the remaining 2 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil. Season the crumbs with salt and pepper and combine with cheese. Place the casserole on the second shelf under broiler and brown breadcrumbs and cheese for 5 minutes.

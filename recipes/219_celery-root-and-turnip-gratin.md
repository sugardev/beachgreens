Celery Root and Turnip Gratin
=============================

Adapted from [The Pioneer Woman](http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2008/11/turnip-gratin/)

**Serves:** 6

 

**Preparation Time:** 30 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   4 whole turnips, peeled and thinly sliced
-   1 celery root, peeled and thinly sliced
-   3 -4 cloves garlic, minced
-   2 cups grated Gruyere Cheese
-   4-6 Tablespoons unsalted butter
-   Chicken or vegetable broth
-   Heavy Cream
-   Salt And Pepper, to taste
-   Fresh Herbs, to taste

 

**Instructions:**

 

Preheat the oven to 375º. In a large oven-proof skillet, melt 2-3 tablespoons of butter over medium-low heat. Place a single layer of turnips on top of the butter.

 

Next, sprinkle a little of the garlic on top, then – and this is purely optional and really not all that necessary – add a couple of tablespoons of butter.

 

Next drizzle a healthy splash of broth over the turnips. Next, do the same with the cream.

 

Now add a nice layer of Gruyere – about ½ cup. Sprinkle a bit of salt, but not much as the cheese is already salty.

 

Repeat these layers twice more, using the celery root slices as part of the layers. Sprinkle on some freshly ground black pepper.

 

Now pop the whole thing into the oven and bake for about 20 minutes or until the top is hot, brown and bubbly.

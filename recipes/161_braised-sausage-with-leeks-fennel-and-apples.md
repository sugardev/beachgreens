Braised Sausage with Leeks, Fennel, and Apples
==============================================

**Serves:** 4
 **Preparation Time:** 1 hour

**Ingredients:**

-   1 ½ Tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
-   1 ½ Tablespoons unsalted butter
-   1 pound pork or chicken sausages
-   3 leeks, white part and softer green part only, cleaned and sliced
-   1 Tablespoon all-purpose flour
-   1 2/3 cup dry hard cider or dry white wine
-   1 fennel bulb, fronds removed, and cut into large chunks
-   1 Tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
-   1 Tablespoon fresh thyme, chopped
-   2 small apples, cored & sliced
-   salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

 

**Instructions:**

Preheat the oven to 350°F.

Heat the oil and butter in a frying pan over medium high heat and fry the sausages until evenly browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a baking dish.

Drain off any excess oil from the frying pan to leave 1 tablespoon. Add the leeks and sauté for a few minutes until they start to brown. Stir in the flour, then gradually add the cider or wine and bring to a boil, stirring. Add the fennel and cook for 2 minutes. Stir in the Worcestershire sauce and thyme. Season well with salt and black pepper. Pour the cider and fennel mixture over the sausages, then cover and cook in the oven for 30 minutes. Add the apples and cook for 10-15 minutes, or until the apples are just tender.

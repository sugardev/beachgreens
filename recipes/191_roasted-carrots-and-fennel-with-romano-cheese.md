=============================================

Adapted from [Teri's Kitchen](http://teriskitchen.com/vegetable/fennelandcarrots.html)

**Serves:** 3-4
 **Preparation Time:** 1 hour

**Ingredients:**

-   1 medium or large fennel bulb with stems and fronds, rinsed and patted dry
-   1 pound carrots, cut into matchsticks
-   2 large garlic cloves, peeled and chopped
-   1 teaspoon dried herb of your choice
-   Salt and pepper to taste
-   Extra virgin olive oil
-   3 tablespoons freshly grated Pecorino Romano cheese

 

**Instructions:**

Preheat oven to 400° F. To prepare the fennel, first cut the stems off the top of the bulb and set aside. Cut a thin slice off of the root end of the bulb and discard. Cut the fennel in half vertically through the flatter side of the bulb. Cut each half into about 1/3-inch thick slices. Remove the fronds from the stems and chop. You will need about one tablespoon of the chopped fronds.

Place the fennel slices on a large baking sheet, lined with foil for easy cleanup. Add the carrots, herb, salt and pepper. Drizzle with oil, about one tablespoon, and toss with your hands to combine. Move the vegetables around until they are in one layer. Roast until the carrots are tender, about 45 minutes. Sprinkle with the cheese, fennel fronds and, if desired, a little more oil. Roast about 5 more minutes. Serve hot or room temperature.

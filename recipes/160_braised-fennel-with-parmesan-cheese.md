Braised Fennel with Parmesan Cheese
===================================

**Serves:** 2-3
 **Preparation Time:** 45 minutes

**Ingredients:**

-   2 fennel bulbs
-   1/2 cup chicken broth
-   1/2 tsp. salt
-   1/2 tsp. freshly-ground black pepper
-   1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

 

**Instructions:**

Preheat oven to 350°F. Wash and trim fennel bulbs: Remove stalks and leaves (save for another use). Cut a thick slice off of the root end. Slice the bulb in half. Remove the hard inner core from each of the halves, and cut into wedges. Place fennel wedges into a 1-quart baking dish. Season with salt and pepper. Pour the chicken broth all over the fennel wedges. Bake, uncovered, 15 minutes. Remove from oven, and sprinkle with the grated Parmesan cheese. Return to oven and bake another 8-12 minutes until cheese is melted, and fennel is soft and tender.
